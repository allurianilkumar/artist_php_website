								<h3>The Mystical Nativity</h3>
							</div>
							<p>
								The Mystical Nativity is a painting of circa 1500â€“1501 by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, in the National Gallery in London. Botticelli built up the image using oil paint on canvas. It is his only signed work, and has a very unusual iconography for a Nativity.

								It has been suggested that the painting may be connected with the influence of Savonarola, whose influence appears in a number of late paintings by Botticelli, though the contents of the image may have been specified by the person commissioning it.~1500~108~75~Tempera on canvas~National Gallery, London
