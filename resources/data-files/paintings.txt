174~1~1~01330~Guernica~<em>Guernica</em> is a painting by Pablo Picasso. It was created in response to the bombing of Guernica, Basque Country, by German and Italian warplanes at the behest of the Spanish Nationalist forces, on 26 April 1937, during the Spanish Civil War. The Spanish Republican government commissioned Picasso to create a large mural for the Spanish display at the Paris International Exposition at the 1937 World's Fair in Paris. <em>Guernica</em> shows the tragedies of war and the suffering it inflicts upon individuals, particularly innocent civilians. This work has gained a monumental status, becoming a perpetual reminder of the tragedies of war, an anti-war symbol, and an embodiment of peace. On completion Guernica was displayed around the world in a brief tour, becoming famous and widely acclaimed. This tour helped bring the Spanish Civil War to the world's attention.~1937~349~776~Oil on canvas~Museo Reina Sofia, Madrid~$1800.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Guernica_(painting)
7~1~1~01080~Family of Saltimbanques~<em>Family of Saltimbanques</em> (La famille de saltimbanques) is a 1905 painting by Pablo Picasso. It is considered the masterpiece of Picasso's circus period. The painting depicts six saltimbanques, a kind of itinerant circus performer, in a desolate landscape. The composition groups them together, but they do not seem connected to each other and are not looking at each other.[~1905~213~230~Oil on canvas~National Gallery of Art, Washington~$170.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Family_of_Saltimbanques
12~1~1~01150~Portrait of Gertrude Stein~By 1905 Picasso became a favorite of the American art collectors Leo and Gertrude Stein. Their older brother Michael Stein and his wife Sarah also became collectors of his work. Picasso painted portraits of both Gertrude Stein and her nephew Allan Stein. Gertrude Stein became Picasso's principal patron, acquiring his drawings and paintings and exhibiting them in her informal Salon at her home in Paris. At one of her gatherings in 1905, he met Henri Matisse, who was to become a lifelong friend and rival. The Steins introduced him to Claribel Cone and her sister Etta who were American art collectors; they also began to acquire Picasso and Matisse's paintings. Eventually Leo Stein moved to Italy, and Michael and Sarah Stein became patrons of Matisse; while Gertrude Stein continued to collect Picasso.~1907~100~81~oil on canvas~The Met, New York City~$300.00~http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/210008443
15~1~1~01180~Three Women~This is one of the most important of Picasso's Cubist works. He made about seventy sketches and rough drafts for it. The artist took the traditional subject of the Three Graces and reworked it in his own style.~1908~200~178~Oil on canvas~State Museum of New Western Art, Moscow~$450.00~http://www.hermitagemuseum.org/html_En/03/hm3_3_1_8c.html
16~1~1~01190~Woman and Child on the Seashore~Inspired by ancient art he saw while in Rome, Picasso began painting heavy-set figures in a neoclassical mode. In 1918, having married the Russian dancer Olga Koklova, Picasso was drawn to images of mothers with children.~1921~143~162~Oil on canvas~The Art Institute of Chicago~$500.00~http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/exhibitions/modernwing/artwork/109275
18~1~1~01220~Portrait of Dora Maar~The canvas was one of many portraits of Dora Maar painted by Pablo Picasso over their nearly decade-long relationship. Picasso fell in love with the 29-year old Maar at the age of 55 and soon began living with her.~1937~92~65~Oil on canvas~Musée Picasso, Paris, France~$500.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dora_Maar_au_Chat
26~1~1~01140~Les Demoiselles d'Avignon~<em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em> (The Young Ladies of Avignon, and originally titled The Brothel of Avignon) is a large oil painting of 1907 by the Spanish artist Pablo Picasso (1881–1973). The work portrays five nude female prostitutes from a brothel on Carrer d'Avinyó (Avinyó Street) in Barcelona. Each figure is depicted in a disconcerting confrontational manner and none are conventionally feminine. The women appear as slightly menacing and rendered with angular and disjointed body shapes. Two are shown with African mask-like faces and three more with faces in the Iberian style of Picasso's native Spain, giving them a savage aura. In this adaptation of Primitivism and abandonment of perspective in favor of a flat, two-dimensional picture plane, Picasso makes a radical departure from traditional European painting. The work is widely considered to be seminal in the early development of both cubism and modern art. Demoiselles was revolutionary and controversial, and led to wide anger and disagreement, even amongst his closest associates and friends. Painted in Paris during the summer of 1907, Picasso had created hundreds of sketches and studies in preparation for the final work. He long acknowledged the importance of Spanish art and Iberian sculpture as influences on the painting. The work is believed by critics to be influenced by African tribal masks and the art of Oceania, although Picasso denied the connection; many art historians remain skeptical about his denials. Several experts maintain that, at the very least, Picasso visited the Musée d'Ethnographie du Trocadéro (known today as Musée de l'Homme) in the spring of 1907 where he saw and was unconsciously influenced by African and Tribal art several months before completing Demoiselles. Some critics argue that the painting was a reaction to Henri Matisse's Le bonheur de vivre and Blue Nude.~1907~244~234~Oil on canvas~The Museum of Modern Art, New York~$99.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Les_Demoiselles_d%27Avignon
29~1~1~01260~Three Musicians~<em>Three Musicians</em> is the title of two similar collage and oil paintings by Spanish artist Pablo Picasso. They were both completed in 1921 in Fontainebleau near Paris, France, and exemplify the Synthetic Cubist style. Each painting features a Harlequin, a Pierrot, and a monk, who are generally believed to represent Picasso, Guillaume Apollinaire, and Max Jacob, respectively.~1921~203~188~Oil on canvas~Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia, PA~$500.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Three_Musicians
31~1~1~01280~Girl Before a Mirror~<em>Girl Before a Mirror</em> shows Picasso's young mistress Marie-Thérèse Walter, one of his favorite subjects in the early 1930s. Her white-haloed profile, rendered in a smooth lavender pink, appears serene. But it merges with a more roughly painted, frontal view of her face—a crescent, like the moon, yet intensely yellow, like the sun, and "made up" with a gilding of rouge, lipstick, and green eye-shadow. Perhaps the painting suggests both Walter's day-self and her night-self, both her tranquillity and her vitality, but also the transition from an innocent girl to a worldly woman aware of her own sexuality.~1932~162~130~Oil on canvas~The Museum of Modern Art, New York~$600.00~http://www.moma.org/collection/object.php?object_id=78311
32~1~1~01290~The Dream~This painting depicts Marie-Thérèse Walter (July 13, 1909 – October 20, 1977) who was the French mistress and model of Pablo Picasso from 1927 to about 1935, and the mother of his daughter, Maya Widmaier-Picasso. Their relationship began when she was seventeen years old; he was 45 and still living with his first wife, Olga Khokhlova. It ended when Picasso moved on to his next mistress, artist Dora Maar.~1932~130~97~Oil on canvas~Private Collection~$380.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marie-Th%C3%A9r%C3%A8se_Walter
6~1~1~01070~The Actor~Picasso painted <em>The Actor</em> over another painting, because he could not afford new canvases at the time. He created the painting over the winter of 1904–1905, at the age of 23. This was during the artist's Rose Period, when he changed his painting style from the downbeat tones of his Blue Period to warmer and more romantic hues. The painting currently resides in the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York City. It was donated to the museum in 1952 by automobile heiress Thelma Chrysler Foy, daughter of Walter Chrysler, the founder of the Chrysler automobile company. Experts estimate that the painting, which is considered to be one of the biggest from Picasso's Rose Period, is worth more than US$100 million.~1904~196~115~Oil on canvas~The Met, New York City~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Actor_(painting)
102~2~36~02030~Joy of Life~<em>Le bonheur de vivre</em> (The joy of Life), is a painting by Henri Matisse. In the central background of the piece is a group of figures that is similar to the group depicted in his painting The Dance (second version). According to Hilton Kramer "Le bonheur de vivre owing to its long sequestration in the collection of the Barnes Foundation, which never permitted its reproduction in color, is the least familiar of modern masterpieces. Yet this painting was Matisse's own response to the hostility his work had met with in the Salon d'Automne of 1905, a response that entrenched his art even more deeply in the esthetic principles that had governed his Fauvist paintings which had caused a furor and which did so on a far grander scale, too."~1905~175~241~Oil on canvas~ Barnes Foundation, Merion, PA~$340.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_bonheur_de_vivre
343~2~36~02080~Dance (II)~There are two versions of <em>The Dance</em>, the first, painted in March of 1909, is the study for the second one, completed in 1910. The large work, painted along the lines of William Blake’s painting <em>Oberon, Titania and Puck with Fairies Dancing</em>, was painted along with its companion piece, Music, which depicts nudes playing music in a similar setting. The pieces were specially created for Russian businessman and art collector Sergei Shchukin, who was a long-time associate of Matisse’s. This painting is often recognized as a key point in the development of Matisse’s artwork, as well as in the development of modern painting. It is also often associated with “Dance of the Young Girls,” in <em>The Rite of Spring</em> by Igor Stravinsky.~1910~260~391~Oil on canvas~The Hermitage, St. Petersburg, Russia~$500.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dance_(Matisse)
342~2~36~02070~The Red Madras Headdress~<em>Madras Rouge</em> (<em>The Red Madras Headress</em>) is a painting by Henri Matisse from 1907. The woman depicted is the painter's wife, Amélie Noellie Parayre Matisse.~1907~99~80~Oil on canvas~The Barnes Foundation, Merion, Pennsylvania~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madras_Rouge
177~2~36~02010~Woman With Hat~<em>Woman with a Hat</em> (La femme au chapeau) is a painting by Henri Matisse from 1905. It is believed that the woman in the painting was Matisse's wife, Amelie. It was exhibited with the work of other artists, now known as "Fauves" at the 1905 Salon d'Automne. Critic Louis Vauxcelles described the work with the phrase "Donatello au milieu des fauves!" (Donatello among the wild beasts), referring to a Renaissance-type sculpture that shared the room with them. His comment was printed on 17 October 1905 in Gil Blas, a daily newspaper, and passed into popular usage. The pictures gained considerable condemnation, such as "A pot of paint has been flung in the face of the public" from the critic Camille Mauclair, but also some favorable attention. The painting that was singled out for attacks was Matisse's Woman with a Hat, which was bought by Gertrude and Leo Stein: this had a very positive effect on Matisse, who was suffering demoralisation from the bad reception of his work.~1905~79~60~Oil on canvas~San Francisco Museum of Modern Art~$340.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Woman_with_a_Hat
341~2~36~02060~Portrait of Madame Matisse~<em>The Green Line</em> (<em>La Raie Verte</em>) also known as <em>The Green Stripe</em> or <em>Mme Matisse</em>, is a portrait of Henri Matisse's wife, Amélie Noellie Matisse-Parayre. He painted it in 1905, just prior to such work being labeled as that of Les Fauves (the wild beasts).~1905~40~32~Oil on canvas~Statens Museum for Kunst, Copenhagen~$500.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Green_Stripe
139~5~33~05010~The Oath of the Horatii~<em>Oath of the Horatii</em> (French: Le Serment des Horaces), is a work by French artist Jacques-Louis David painted in 1784. It depicts a scene from a Roman legend about a dispute between two warring cities; Rome and Alba Longa, when three brothers from a Roman family, the Horatii, agree to end the war by fighting three brothers from an Alba Longa family, the Curiatii. The three brothers, all of which appear willing to sacrifice their lives for the good of Rome, are shown saluting their father who holds their swords out for them. The principal sources for the story behind David's Oath are the first book of Livy (sections 24-6) which was elaborated by Dionysius in book 3 of his Roman Antiquities. However, the moment depicted in David's painting is his own invention. It grew to be considered a paradigm of neoclassical art. The painting increased David's fame, allowing him to rear his own students.~1784~330~425~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$800.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Oath_of_the_Horatii
344~5~33~05020~Lictors Bearing to Brutus the Bodies of his Sons~The work had tremendous appeal for the time. Before the opening of the Salon, the French Revolution had begun. The National Assembly had been established, and the Bastille had fallen. The royal court did not want propaganda agitating the people, so all paintings had to be checked before being hung. David’s portrait of Lavoisier, who was a chemist and physicist as well as an active member of the Jacobin party, was banned by the authorities for such reasons. When the newspapers reported that the government had not allowed the showing of The Lictors Bring to Brutus the Bodies of His Sons, the people were outraged, and the royals were forced to give in. The painting was hung in the exhibition, protected by art students. The painting depicts Lucius Junius Brutus, the Roman leader, grieving for his sons. Brutus's sons had attempted to overthrow the government and restore the monarchy, so the father ordered their death to maintain the republic. Thus, Brutus was the heroic defender of the republic, at the cost of his own family. On the right, the Mother holds her two daughters, and the servant is seen on the far right, in anguish. Brutus sits on a klismos on the left, alone, brooding, but knowing what he did was best for his country. The whole painting was a Republican symbol, and obviously had immense meaning during these times in France. Note Brutus' tense, crossed feet in the picture, the sharp scissors that lay dead in the center of the painting, and the use of light and dark to draw a distinction between Brutus and his wife. Brutus does not even look back as his headless sons are brought into the room.~1789~323~422~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$800.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lictors_Bring_to_Brutus_the_Bodies_of_His_Sons
345~5~33~05030~The Death of Marat~<em>The Death of Marat</em> (French: <em>La Mort de Marat</em>) is a 1793 painting in the Neoclassical style by Jacques-Louis David, and is one of the most famous images of the French Revolution. This work depicts the radical journalist Jean-Paul Marat lying dead in his bath on 13 July 1793 after his murder by Charlotte Corday. Corday, who was from a minor aristocratic family, blamed Marat for the September Massacres and feared an all out civil war, claimed "I killed one man to save 100,000." It has been described as the first modernist painting.~1793~162~128~Oil on canvas~Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium~$450.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Death_of_Marat
346~5~33~05040~The Intervention of the Sabine Women~<em>The Intervention of the Sabine Women</em> is a 1799 painting by the French painter Jacques-Louis David. The work was considered when Jacques-Louis David was imprisoned in the Luxembourg Palace in 1795; he hesitated between representing either this subject or that of Homer reciting his verses to the Greeks. He finally chose to make a canvas representing the Sabine women interposing themselves to separate the Romans and Sabines, as a 'sequel' to Poussin's <em>The Rape of the Sabine Women</em>. Its realization took him nearly four years.~1799~385~522~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$700.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Intervention_of_the_Sabine_Women
347~5~33~05050~Napoleon Crossing the Alps~<em>Napoleon Crossing the Alps</em> (also known as <em>Napoleon at the Saint-Bernard Pass</em> or <em>Bonaparte Crossing the Alps</em>) is the title given to the five versions of an oil on canvas equestrian portrait of Napoleon Bonaparte painted by the French artist Jacques-Louis David between 1801 and 1805. Initially commissioned by the king of Spain, the composition shows a strongly idealized view of the real crossing that Napoleon and his army made across the Alps through the Great St. Bernard Pass in May 1800.~1800~261~221~Oil on canvas~Château de Malmaison, Rueil-Malmaison~$250.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_at_the_Saint-Bernard_Pass
348~5~33~05060~The Coronation of Napoleon~<em>The Coronation of Napoleon</em> (French: <em>Le Sacre de Napoléon</em>) is a painting completed in 1807 by Jacques-Louis David, the official painter of Napoleon. The painting has imposing dimensions, as it is almost ten metres wide by approximately six metres tall. The crowning and the coronation took place at Notre-Dame de Paris, a way for Napoleon to make it clear that he was a son of the Revolution.~1805~621~979~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$1200.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Coronation_of_Napoleon
140~6~34~06010~Mademoiselle Caroline Riviere~The portrait of Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière was painted in 1806 by the French Neoclassical artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres, and today hangs in the Louvre. It is the third of three portraits of the Rivière family the artist painted that year. Caroline's father, Philibert Rivière, was a successful court official under Napoleon's empire, and sought to commemorate himself, his wife and daughter through a commission with the then young and rising artist - his portraits of Philibert and his wife are also still extant. Although Ingres favoured subject matter drawn from history or Greek legend, at this early stage in his career he earned his living mainly through commissions from wealthy patrons.[1] The family lived outside Paris, at St. Germain-en-Laye, and Mademoiselle Caroline Rivière would have been between 13 and 15 at the time she was portrayed; according to Ingres the "ravishing daughter". The younger Rivière's portrait describes slightly-built and youthful femininity and hints at a hesitant openness. The painting is rendered in bright hues and set against a serene white–blue early spring landscape, the freshness of which was intended to reflect the youth of the sitter. The background is not deeply portrayed; the perspective is shallow and rises—according to the art historian Robert Rosenblum—in "flattened horizontal tiers against which the figure seems crisply silhouetted as if in low relief." Typical of portraits by Ingres of the time, Caroline Rivière is drawn with a disregard for anatomical accuracy. Her neck is overly elongated, and the bridge of her nose extends too far.Rivière is portrayed with a stiffness and awkwardness typical of her age, and shown in a manner which was intended to emphasise a sense of the nascent purity and simplicity of her youth. Yet the painting is generally seen in the light of pathos and tragedy, as the sitter died within a year of the work being completed~1806~100~70~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mademoiselle_Caroline_Rivi%C3%A8re
141~6~34~06020~Betty de Rothschild, Baronne de Rothschild~<em>Baronne de Rothschild</em> is a 1848 oil and canvas portrait by the French Neoclassical artist Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres. The sitter, Betty de Rothschild (1805-1886) had married banker James Mayer de Rothschild and was one of the wealthiest women in northern Europe, and one of the foremost Parisian patrons of the arts. Her beauty and elegance were widely known and celebrated, and inspired Heinrich Heine's poem The Angel. For her portrait, Ingres sought to infuse symbols of her material wealth with the dignity, grace and beauty of Renaissance art, especially that of Raphael, while at the same time adhering to the command of line as practiced by Jan van Eyck. It is this combination which, according to art historians, places Ingres' so far apart from his early modernist contemporaries. Betty de Rothschild's portrait is regarded as one of Ingres' most accomplished works, and has been described as "perhaps the most sumptuous yet approachable image of mid-nineteenth-century opulence."~1848~142~101~Oil on canvas~Private collection~$550.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baronne_de_Rothschild
35~6~34~06030~La Grande Odalisque~<em>Grande Odalisque</em>, also known as Une Odalisque or La Grande Odalisque, is an oil painting of 1814 by Jean Auguste Dominique Ingres depicting an odalisque, or concubine. Ingres' contemporaries considered the work to signify Ingres' break from Neoclassicism, indicating a shift toward exotic Romanticism. Grande Odalisque attracted wide criticism when it was first shown. It has been especially noted for the elongated proportions and lack of anatomical realism. The work is housed in the Louvre, Paris. This eclectic mix of styles, combining classical form with Romantic themes, prompted harsh criticism when it was first shown in 1814. Critics viewed Ingres as a rebel against the contemporary style of form and content. When the painting was first shown in the Salon of 1819, one critic remarked that the work had "neither bones nor muscle, neither blood, nor life, nor relief, indeed nothing that constitutes imitation".[3] This echoed the general view that Ingres had disregarded anatomical realism.[4] Ingres instead favored long lines to convey curvature and sensuality, as well as abundant, even light to tone down the volume. Ingres continued to be criticized for his work until the mid-1820s.~1814~89~163~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$175.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Grande_Odalisque
142~7~33~07010~Death of Sardanapalus~<em>Death of Sardanapalus</em> (La Mort de Sardanapale) is an oil painting on canvas, dated 1827 by Eugène Delacroix. Its dominant feature is a large divan, with its golden elephants, on which a nude prostrates herself and beseeches the apathetic Sardanapalus for mercy. Sardanapalus (Detail) had ordered his possessions destroyed and sex slaves murdered before immolating himself, once he learned that he was faced with military defeat.~1827~392~496~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$1175.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Death_of_Sardanapalus
36~7~33~07020~Liberty Leading the People~<em>Liberty Leading the People</em> (French: La Liberté guidant le peuple) is a painting by Eugène Delacroix commemorating the July Revolution of 1830, which toppled Charles X of France. A woman personifying Liberty leads the people forward over the bodies of the fallen, holding the tricolore flag of the French Revolution in one hand and brandishing a bayonetted musket with the other. The painting is perhaps Delacroix's best-known work. Delacroix depicted Liberty, as both an allegorical goddess-figure and a robust woman of the people, an approach that contemporary critics denounced as "ignoble". The mound of corpses acts as a kind of pedestal from which Liberty strides, barefoot and bare-breasted, out of the canvas and into the space of the viewer. The Phrygian cap she wears had come to symbolize liberty during the first French Revolution, of 1789-94. The painting has been seen as a marker to the end of the Age of Enlightenment, as many scholars see the end of the French Revolution as the start of the romantic era. The fighters are from a mixture of social classes, ranging from the bourgeoisie represented by the young man in a top hat, to the revolutionary urban worker, as exemplified by the boy holding pistols (who may have been the inspiration for the character Gavroche in Victor Hugo's Les Misérables). What they have in common is the fierceness and determination in their eyes. Aside from the flag held by Liberty, a second, minute tricolore can be discerned in the distance flying from the towers of Notre Dame.~1830~260~325~Oil on canvas~Musée du Louvre, Paris~$860.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liberty_Leading_the_People
37~10~34~10020~Burial at Ornans~<em>The Burial</em>, one of Courbet's most important works, records the funeral of his grandfather which he attended in September 1848. People who attended the funeral were the models for the painting. Previously, models had been used as actors in historical narratives, but in <em>Burial</em> Courbet said he "painted the very people who had been present at the interment, all the townspeople". The result is a realistic presentation of them, and of life in Ornans. The vast painting—it measures 10 by 22 feet (3.1 by 6.6 meters)—drew both praise and fierce denunciations from critics and the public, in part because it upset convention by depicting a prosaic ritual on a scale which previously would have been reserved for a religious or royal subject.~1849~314~663~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$190.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Burial_at_Ornans
182~10~34~10060~The Painter's Studio; A Real Allegory~<em>The Artist's Studio: A Real Allegory of a Seven Year Phase in my Artistic and Moral Life </em> is an allegory of Coubet's life as a painter, seen as an heroic venture, in which he is flanked by friends and admirers on the right, and challenges and opposition to the left. Friends on the right include the art critics Champfleury, and Charles Baudelaire, and art collector Alfred Bruyas. On the left are figures (priest, prostitute, grave digger, merchant and others) who represent what Courbet described in a letter to Champfleury as "the other world of trivial life, the people, misery, poverty, wealth, the exploited and the exploiters, the people who live off death." In the foreground of the left-hand side is a man with dogs, who was not mentioned in Courbet's letter to Champfleury. X-rays show he was painted in later, but his role in the painting is important: he is an allegory of the then current French Emperor, Napoleon III, identified by his famous hunting dogs and iconic twirled moustache. By placing him on the left, Courbet publicly shows his disdain for the emperor and depicts him as a criminal, suggesting that his "ownership" of France is an illegal one.~1855~361~598~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$325.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Artist%27s_Studio
39~12~35~12060~Bar at the Folies Bergere~<em>A Bar at the Folies-Bergère</em> (French: Un bar aux Folies Bergère), painted and exhibited at the Paris Salon in 1882, was the last major work by French painter Édouard Manet. It depicts a scene in the Folies Bergère nightclub in Paris. The painting is filled with contemporaneous details specific to the Folies-Bergère. The distant pair of green feet in the upper left-hand corner belong to a trapeze artist, who is performing above the restaurant's patrons. The beer which is depicted, Bass Pale Ale (noted by the red triangle on the label), would have catered not to the tastes of Parisians, but to those of English tourists, suggesting a British clientele. Manet has signed his name on the label of the bottle at the bottom left, combining the centuries-old practice of self-promotion in art with something more modern, bordering on the product placement concept of the late twentieth century. One interpretation of the painting has been that far from only being a seller of the wares shown on the counter, the woman is herself one of the wares for sale; conveying undertones of prostitution. The man in the background may be a potential client. But for all its specificity to time and place, it is worth noting that, should the background of this painting indeed be a reflection in a mirror on the wall behind the bar as suggested by some critics, the woman in the reflection would appear directly behind the image of the woman facing forward. Neither are the bottles reflected accurately or in like quantity for it to be a reflection. These details were criticized in the French press when the painting was shown. The assumption is faulty when one considers that the postures of the two women, however, are quite different and the presence of the man to whom the second woman speaks marks the depth of the subject area. Indeed many critics view the faults in the reflection to be fundamental to the painting as they show a double reality and meaning to the work. One interpretation is that the reflection is an interaction earlier in time that results in the subject's expression in the painting's present.~1882~96~130~Oil on canvas~Courtauld Institute Galleries, London~$200.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Bar_at_the_Folies-Berg%C3%A8re
173~12~35~12010~Luncheon on the Grass~<em>The Luncheon on the Grass</em> (Le déjeuner sur l'herbe) was rejected by the Paris Salon in 1863 but Manet exhibited it at the Salon des Refusés (Salon of the Rejected) later in the year. Emperor Napoleon III had initiated The Salon des Refusés after the Paris Salon rejected more than 4,000 paintings in 1863. The painting's juxtaposition of fully dressed men and a nude woman was controversial, as was its abbreviated, sketch-like handling, an innovation that distinguished Manet from Courbet. At the same time, Manet's composition reveals his study of the old masters, as the disposition of the main figures is derived from Marcantonio Raimondi's engraving of the Judgement of Paris (c. 1515) based on a drawing by Raphael. Two additional works that are cited by scholars as important precedents for Le déjeuner sur l'herbe are <em>Pastoral Concert</em> (c. 1510, The Louvre) and <em>The Tempest</em> (Gallerie dell'Accademia, Venice), both of which are attributed variously to Italian Renaissance masters Giorgione or Titian. The Tempest is an enigmatic painting that features a fully dressed man and a nude woman in a rural setting. The man is standing to the left and gazing to the side, apparently at the woman, who is seated and is breastfeeding a baby; the relationship between the two figures is unclear. In Pastoral Concert, two clothed men and a nude woman are seated on the grass, engaged in music making, while a second nude woman stands beside them.~1863~214~269~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_d%C3%A9jeuner_sur_l%27herbe
288~12~35~12050~Music in the Tuileries~It is an early example of Manet's painterly style, inspired by Frans Hals and Diego Velázquez, and it is a harbinger of his life-long interest in the subject of leisure.~1862~76~118~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, London~$350.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Music_in_the_Tuileries
287~12~35~12020~Olympia~As he had in <em>Luncheon on the Grass</em>, Manet again paraphrased a respected work by a Renaissance artist in the painting <em>Olympia</em> (1863), a nude portrayed in a style reminiscent of early studio photographs, but whose pose was based on Titian's <em>Venus of Urbino</em> (1538). The painting is also reminiscent of Francisco Goya's painting, <em>The Nude Maja</em> (1800). Manet embarked on the canvas after being challenged to give the Salon a nude painting to display. His uniquely frank depiction of a self-assured prostitute was accepted by the Paris Salon in 1865, where it created a scandal. According to Antonin Proust, "only the precautions taken by the administration prevented the painting being punctured and torn" by offended viewers. The painting was controversial partly because the nude is wearing some small items of clothing such as an orchid in her hair, a bracelet, a ribbon around her neck, and mule slippers, all of which accentuated her nakedness, sexuality, and comfortable courtesan lifestyle. The orchid, upswept hair, black cat, and bouquet of flowers were all recognized symbols of sexuality at the time. This modern Venus' body is thin, counter to prevailing standards; the painting's lack of idealism rankled viewers. The painting's flatness, inspired by Japanese wood block art, serves to make the nude more human and less voluptuous. A fully dressed black servant is featured, exploiting the then-current theory that black people were hyper-sexed. That she is wearing the clothing of a servant to a courtesan here, furthers the sexual tension of the piece. Olympia's body as well as her gaze is unabashedly confrontational. She defiantly looks out as her servant offers flowers from one of her male suitors. Although her hand rests on her leg, hiding her pubic area, the reference to traditional female virtue is ironic; a notion of modesty is notoriously absent in this work. A contemporary critic denounced Olympia's "shamelessly flexed" left hand, which seemed to him a mockery of the relaxed, shielding hand of Titian's Venus.Likewise, the alert black cat at the foot of the bed strikes a sexually rebellious note in contrast to that of the sleeping dog in Titian's portrayal of the goddess in his Venus of Urbino.~1863~130~190~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$225.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Olympia_(Manet)
179~13~34~13020~Nocturne in Black and Gold: The Falling Rocket~<em>Nocturne in Black and Gold – The Falling Rocket</em> is an 1870s painting by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. It depicts a fireworks show in the night sky over Battersea Bridge in an industrial London city park. This painting was first shown at the Grosvenor Gallery in London in 1877. It is the last of the London Nocturnes and is now widely acknowledged to be the high point of Whistler's middle period.~1874~60~47~Oil on wood~Detroit Institute of Arts~$200.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nocturne_in_Black_and_Gold:_The_Falling_Rocket
152~13~34~13030~Arrangement in Grey and Black: Portrait of the Painter's Mother~<em>Arrangement in Grey and Black: The Artist's Mother</em>, famous under its colloquial name Whistler's Mother, is an 1871 oil-on-canvas painting by American-born painter James McNeill Whistler.  It occasionally tours worldwide. Although an icon of American art, it rarely appears in the United States.~1871~144~162~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whistler%27s_Mother
178~13~34~13010~Symphony in White, No. 1: The White Girl~<em>Symphony in White, No. 1</em>, also known as <em>The White Girl</em>, is a painting by James Abbott McNeill Whistler. The work shows a woman in full figure standing on a wolf skin in front of a white curtain with a lily in her hand. The colour scheme of the painting is almost entirely white. The model is Joanna Heffernan, the artist's mistress. Though the painting was originally called The White Girl, Whistler later started calling it Symphony in White, No. 1. By referring to his work in such abstract terms, he intended to emphasise his "art for art's sake" philosophy. Whistler created the painting in the winter of 1861–62, though he later returned to it and made alterations. It was rejected both at the Royal Academy and at the Salon in Paris, but eventually accepted at the Salon des Refusés in 1863. This exhibition also featured Édouard Manet's famous Déjeuner sur l'herbe, and together the two works gained a lot of attention. <em>The White Girl</em> shows clearly the influence of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, with whom Whistler had recently come in contact. The painting has been interpreted by later art critics both as an allegory of innocence and its loss, and as a religious allusion to the Virgin Mary.~1862~215~108~Oil on canvas~National Gallery of Art, Washington~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Symphony_in_White,_No._1:_The_White_Girl
153~14~35~14030~Large Bathers~Renoir labored over this painting for a period of three years before he was happy with its composition. Along with at least two full-sized figure drawings of the models, Renoir also created many preparatory drawings for each of the figures before eventually putting brush to canvas. Due to the criticism he received for the painting’s sculptural smoothness and a change in the artist’s perceived style, Renoir, who was exhausted by the effort, claimed that he would never again devote such a long period of time for a single piece of work.~1887~170~116~Oil on canvas~Philadelphia Museum of Art~$370.00~http://www.philamuseum.org/collections/permanent/59196.html
40~14~35~14020~Luncheon Boating Party~The painting depicts a group of Renoir's friends relaxing on a balcony at the Maison Fournaise along the Seine river in Chatou, France. The painter and art patron, Gustave Caillebotte, is seated in the lower right. Renoir's future wife, Aline Charigot, is in the foreground playing with a small dog. On the table is fruit and wine. The diagonal of the railing serves to demarcate the two halves of the composition, one densely packed with figures, the other all but empty, save for the two figures of the proprietor's daughter Louise-Alphonsine Fournaise and her brother, Alphonse Fournaise, Jr, which are made prominent by this contrast. In this painting Renoir has captured a great deal of light. The main focus of light is coming from the large opening in the balcony, beside the large singleted man in the hat. The singlets of both men in the foreground and the table-cloth all work together to reflect this light and send it through the whole composition.~1881~130~173~Oil on canvas~The Phillips Collection, Washington~$380.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luncheon_of_the_Boating_Party
339~14~35~14010~Dance at Le Moulin de la Galette~<em>Dance at Moulin de la Galette</em> is one of Impressionism’s most highly revered masterpieces. The scene is of a Sunday afternoon at Moulin de la Galette, where Parisians would typically dress up and spend all day dancing, drinking, and eating galettes, or flat cakes. The painting was in the collection of Gustave Caillebotte, but it was claimed by the French government upon his death due to the non payment of death duties. It was later transferred from the Luxembourg Museum, to the Louvre, and then later to the Musee d’Orsay. Its sale price at auction in 2009 was the fifth highest price ever paid for a painting at auction.~1876~131~175~Oil on canvas~Musée d'Orsay, Paris~$550.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bal_du_moulin_de_la_Galette
155~15~35~15020~Place de la Concorde~This painting depicts the Viscount Ludovic-Napoleon Lepic and his two daughters, strolling through the Place de la Concorde in Paris, France. For four decades after World War II, this painting was considered lost. It was found when it was put on display at the Hermitage Museum in Russia, where it still remains. It was later discovered that the Russians had seized the painting from the collections of Otto Gerstenberg during the Soviet occupation of Germany following World War II. The composition, with a large amount of negative space, is thought by art historians to be based off of a photograph, which was an interest of Degas’ in his later life.~1875~78~118~Oil on canvas~Hermitage, St. Petersburg, Russia~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Place_de_la_Concorde_(painting)
159~15~35~15080~Race Horses~Race horses and Jockeys, even more than dancers, occupied Degas throughout his long career as an artist. Paul-Andre Lemoisne catalogued some ninety-one works in this category, spanning the period from 1860 to 1900--a number that did not include Degas's equestrian waxes and bronzes--and they embrace a range of sizes and mediums. As with the Paris Opera, the spectacle of the turf gave Degas the base material from which to forge images of modern life in an alloy that fused references to the art of the past with details observed from life and scrupulously documented. But more than any other of his subjects, this was a genre that fed upon itself and spawned countless variations and adjustments. From a repertory established very early, Degas proceeded to select individual jockeys and rearrange them, to repeat poses and refine them, until this hermetic world lost all connection with the reality of the race track. This diminutive composition of Race Horses, which falls toward the end of the first phase in this development, is immediately distinguished by its unusual support. It is pastel, and not oil, on panel: the wood here, possibly light mahogany, is the kind that might be used for cigar boxes. Although pastel on panel is not a unique combination, it is extremely rare in Degas's oeuvre, and testifies to his continuing pleasure in experimenting with techniques and supports.~1885~30~41~Pastel on panel~Philadelphia Museum of Art~$70.00~http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/degas/race-horses/
42~15~35~15050~Glass of Absinthe~<em>L'Absinthe</em> (English: The Absinthe Drinker or Glass of Absinthe) is a painting by Edgar Degas. Some original title translations are A sketch of a French Café, then Figures at Café, the title was finally changed in 1893 to L’Absinthe (the name the piece is known by today). It is now in the permanent collection of the Musée d'Orsay in Paris. Painted in 1875-1876, it depicts two figures, a woman and man, who sit in the center and right of this painting, respectively. The man, wearing a hat, looks right, off the canvas, while the woman, dressed formally and also wearing a hat, stares vacantly downward. A glass filled with the eponymous greenish liquid sits before her. The painting is a representation of the increasing social isolation in Paris during its stage of rapid growth.~1877~92~68~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%27Absinthe
162~15~35~15100~The Tub~Degas, in the Classic line of descent from Ingres as a draughtsman--and one of the greatest in Europe since the giants of the Renaissance--exchanged oil paint for pastel, as in this example, with a sense of greater freedom in being able to draw in the medium as well as to apply color. The word "classic" refers to his preoccupation with the human figure but not to any desire to depict an ideal type of humanity. Remarking that "la femme en général est laide" he showed no disposition to modify this supposed ugliness. He quickly abandoned the antique subject-matter of pictorial composition after his few early essays.~1886~60~83~Pastel on paper~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$90.00~http://www.ibiblio.org/wm/paint/auth/degas/combing-hair/
154~15~35~15010~The Belleli Family~Degas’ early masterpiece, <em>The Bellelli Family</em> depicts his aunt, her husband and their two little girls. It is believed that the artist drew each of the figures individually, later combining them in this unique portrayal of their family dynamic. The woman, Degas’ aunt Laura, wears a black dress in mourning for her recently deceased father, whose portrait hangs on the wall behind her. It is likely that this portrait hung at the Paris Salon of 1867, but it was badly hung and as a result was largely ignored by the critics. As a result, Degas kept it in his personal collection, where it remained until he left it to his dealer in 1913. In 1918, after his death, it was revealed an exhibition of the artist’s estate, and was immediately bought for 400,000 by the Luxembourg Museum.~1860~200~250~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_the_Bellelli_Family
47~17~35~17070~The Houses of Parliament (Effect of Fog)~In the fall of 1899 and the early months of 1900 and of 1901, Monet executed a series of views of the Thames River in London. From his room at the Savoy Hotel, he painted Waterloo Bridge to the east, and Charing Cross Bridge to the west; beginning in February 1900, he set up his easel on a terrace at Saint Thomas's Hospital across the river, reserving time in the late afternoon to depict the Houses of Parliament. While in London, Monet produced nearly a hundred canvases, reportedly moving from one to another as the light changed. He continued to work on these paintings in his studio at Giverny. In May 1904, thirty-seven were exhibited at the Galerie Durand-Ruel in Paris, including this view of the Houses of Parliament cloaked in dense fog.~1903~81~92~Oil on canvas~The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York~$300.00~http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/110001576
44~17~35~17010~Impression Sunrise~In 1872, Monet painted <em>Impression, Sunrise</em> (Impression, soleil levant) depicting a Le Havre port landscape. It hung in the first Impressionist exhibition in 1874 and is now displayed in the Musée Marmottan Monet in Paris. From the painting's title, art critic Louis Leroy coined the term "Impressionism", which he intended as disparagement but which the Impressionists appropriated for themselves.~1872~48~63~Oil on canvas~Musee Marmottan, Paris~$130.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impression,_Sunrise
45~17~35~17020~Women in the Garden~Monet’s technique of “en plein air” painting was hard at work on this painting. Because it necessitated that he work from the same point of view as he painted, he dug a trench for the bottom half of the painting to sit in while he painted the top, due to its large size (it measures 100 by 81 inches). His model for the women of the painting was Camille Doncieux, who would later become his wife, bearing him two sons. To finish the dresses in the most fashionable style, Monet used magazine illustrations to render the clothing.~1866~205~255~Oil on canvas~Musee d'Orsay, Paris~$1050.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Women_in_the_Garden
48~17~35~17060~Water Lilies~Monet left much of his late work unfinished and released few paintings for sale, reporting that he was not yet satisfied and was still working on them "with passion." This canvas is one of four water-lily pictures that, quite exceptionally, he did complete, sign, and sell in 1919.~1919~101~200~Oil on canvas~The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York~$300.00~http://www.metmuseum.org/Collections/search-the-collections/110002464
349~18~36~18090~Two Tahitian Women~The painting depicts two topless women, one holding mango blossoms, on the Pacific Island of Tahiti. Currently, the painting is housed at the National Gallery of Art, on loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York. Although Tahiti is depicted as an innocent paradise, the two women in the painting confront the viewer in a way similar to that in Manet's <em>Le déjeuner sur l'herbe</em> (1863) or <em>Olympia </em>(1863), and follow an artistic tradition of comparing woman's breasts to flowers or fruit. The women in the painting also appear in two other works by Gauguin, <em>Faa Iheihe</em> (Tahitian Pastoral) (1898) and <em>Rupe, Rupe</em> (1899).~1899~94~72~Oil on canvas~The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two_Tahitian_Women
172~18~36~18060~Spirit of the Dead Watching~<em>Spirit of the Dead Watching</em> (Manao tupapau) is an 1892 oil on burlap canvas painting by Paul Gauguin, depicting a nude Tahitian girl lying on her stomach. An old woman is seated behind her. In Tahitian mythology the title may refer to either the girl imagining the ghost, or the ghost imagining her. The subject of the painting was Gauguin's Tahitian wife Tehura, then 14 years old, who one night, according to Gauguin, was lying in fear when he arrived late home: "immobile, naked, lying face downward on the bed with the eyes inordinately large with fear . . . Might she not with her frightened face take me for one of the demons and spectres of the Tupapaus, with which the legends of her race people sleepless nights?" The spirit she fears is personified by the old woman seated at left. The strong colors are symbolic of the native Polynesian belief that phosphorescent lights were manifestations of the spirits of the dead.~1892~72~92~Oil on burlap mounted on canvas~Albright-Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, NY~$325.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit_of_the_Dead_Watching
54~18~36~18040~Yellow Christ~<em>The Yellow Christ</em>, in addition to <em>The Green Christ</em>, also painted by Gaugin, is said to be one of the key works in Cloisonnism. The Christ in the painting is a direct representation of a crucifix in Pont-Avon, France, where Gaugin visited to paint a number of times. It depicts a yellow form of Christ being crucified in 19th century northern France. French Breton women gather around the cross in prayer. The only shading in the painting is of the women bowed in prayer, the figure of Christ on the cross clearly outlined in black, and his form is flat, typical of the Gaugin’s symbolic style.~1889~92~73~Oil on canvas~Albright Knox Art Gallery, Buffalo, New York~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Yellow_Christ
51~18~36~18020~Vision After the Sermon~This painting depicts the scene from the Bible in which Jacob wrestles an angel. As if in a modern-day wrestling arena, French women watch the wrestling match from afar. This painting was created during Gaugin’s stay in Pont-Avon, France, which is where he created his other masterpieces, The Yellow Christ and The Green Christ. This painting also incorporates elements from his Christ series, which also place Breton French women alongside a Biblical scene, placing them as observers in the story. In his typical style, flat areas of color are outlined by thick black lines, and the figures are void of any shading or depth of color.~1888~74~93~Oil on canvas~National Gallery of Scotland, Edinburgh~$290.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vision_After_the_Sermon
56~18~36~18080~Where Do We Come From? What Are We? Where Are We Going?~This is Paul Gaugin’s most famous painting, and he considered it his masterpiece, and the culmination of his thoughts. In Tahiti, as he was painting his masterpiece, Gaugin declared that he would commit suicide upon its completion. Although this was something he had previously attempted, this was not the case, as the artist died of syphilis in 1903. The painting was meant to be read from right to left, with the three main figures in the painting representing the three questions of the title. The figures are arranged from the beginning stages of life, from young figures with a child, to the middle aged figure in the middle, to the elder figure on the left of the painting. The idol in the background, situated behind the elder figure, represents the “Beyond.”~1897~139~375~Oil on canvas~Museum of Fine Arts, Boston~$800.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Where_Do_We_Come_From%3F_What_Are_We%3F_Where_Are_We_Going%3F
61~19~36~19040~Décoration for the Yellow House~The Décoration for the Yellow House was the main project Vincent van Gogh focused on in Arles, from August 1888 until his breakdown the day before Christmas. This Décoration had no pre-defined form or size; the central idea of the Décoration grew step by step, with the progress of his work. Starting with the Sunflowers, portraits were included in the next step. Finally, mid-September 1888, the idea took shape: from this time on he concentrated on size 30 canvases (Toiles de 30), which were all meant to form part of this Décoration~1888~72~92~Oil on canvas~Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam~$340.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_D%C3%A9coration_for_the_Yellow_House
62~19~36~19030~Sidewalk Café at Night~<em>Café Terrace at Night</em>, also known as The Cafe Terrace on the Place du Forum, is an coloured oil painting on an industrially primed canvas of size 25 (Toile de 25 figure) in Arles, France, mid September 1888. The painting is not signed, but described and mentioned by the artist in his letters on various occasions—and, as well, there is a large pen drawing of the composition which originates from the artist’s estate.~1888~81~66~Oil on canvas~Rijksmuseum Kröller-Müller, Otterlo, Netherlands~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Caf%C3%A9_Terrace_on_the_Place_du_Forum,_Arles,_at_Night
63~19~36~19070~Starry Night~In the later part of his life, Van Gogh committed himself to an asylum in Saint Remy de Provence. <em>The Starry Night</em> was the view from the window in Van Gogh’s sanitarium bedroom. Although it is a night scene, it was painted during the day. The painting is often referred to as Van Gogh’s magnus opus. As he often sent his works to his brother Theo for his approval, he mailed this one to him in late 1889. He also wrote that he was not so happy about the work, which did not seem complete, as he had originally intended it to simply be a study of the night sky.~1889~74~92~Oil on canvas~The Museum of Modern Art, New York~$410.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starry_Night
351~19~36~19110~Postman Joseph Roulin~The Roulin Family is group of portrait paintings Vincent van Gogh executed in Arles in 1888 and 1889 on Joseph, his wife Augustine and their three children: Armand, Camille and Marcelle. This series is unique in many ways. Although Van Gogh loved to paint portraits, it was difficult for financial and other reasons for him to find models. So, finding an entire family that agreed to sit for paintings, in fact for several sittings each was a bounty. Joseph Roulin became a particularly good, loyal and supporting friend to Van Gogh during his stay in Arles. To represent a man he truly admired was important to him. The family, with children ranging in age from four months to seventeen years, also gave him the opportunity to produces works of individuals in several different stages of life. Rather than making photographic-like works, Van Gogh used his imagination, colors and themes artistically and creatively to evoke desired emotions from the audience.~1888~81~65~Oil on canvas~Museum of Fine Arts, Boston~$420.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Roulin_Family_(Van_Gogh_series)
350~19~36~19100~The Night Café~<em>The Night Café</em> (original French title: <em>Le Café de nuit</em>) is an oil painting created in Arles in September 1888, by Vincent van Gogh. Its title is inscribed lower right beneath the signature. The interior depicted is the Café de la Gare, 30 Place Lamartine, run by Joseph-Michel and his wife Marie Ginoux, who in November 1888 posed for Van Gogh's and Gauguin's Arlésienne; a bit later, Joseph Ginoux evidently posed for both artists, too. In one of his letters he describes this painting: “I have tried to express the terrible passions of humanity by means of red and green. The room is blood red and dark yellow with a green billiard table in the middle; there are four lemon-yellow lamps with a glow of orange and green. Everywhere there is a clash and contrast of the most alien reds and greens, in the figures of little sleeping hooligans, in the empty dreary room, in violet and blue. The blood-red and the yellow-green of the billiard table, for instance, contrast with the soft tender Louis XV green of the counter, on which there is a rose nosegay. The white clothes of the landlord, watchful in a corner of that furnace, turn lemon-yellow, or pale luminous green."~1888~72~92~Oil on canvas~Yale University Art Gallery, New Haven~$360.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Night_Caf%C3%A9
59~19~36~19090~Portrait of Dr. Gachet~<em>Portrait of Dr. Gachet</em> is one of the most revered paintings by Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh. It depicts Dr. Paul Gachet, who took care of him during the final months of his life. It was the only portrait painted by van Gogh during his stay at the doctor's home in Auvers-sur-Oise (27.2 km outside Paris), a 70 day period from May to July 1890. In 1990, it fetched a then-record price of $82.5 million ($75 million, plus a 10 percent buyer's commission) when sold at auction in New York~1890~67~56~Oil on canvas~Private Collection~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Dr._Gachet
65~19~36~19080~Wheatfield with Crows~<em>Wheatfield with Crows</em> is a July 1890 painting by Vincent van Gogh. It is commonly but mistakenly stated that this was Van Gogh's last painting. Art historians are uncertain as to which painting was Van Gogh's last, as no clear historical records exist, but the evidence of his letters suggests that Wheatfield with Crows was completed around 10 July and predates such paintings as Auvers Town Hall on 14 July 1890 and Daubigny's Garden.~1890~50~103~Oil on canvas~Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam~$350.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wheatfield_with_Crows
58~19~36~19020~Potato Eaters~For <em>The Potato Eaters</em>, Van Gogh’s first major work, he wanted to depict peasants as they really were. He thus chose coarse and ugly models, so they would look as natural as possible in the final work. He made sketches of the work and sent them to his brother, who helped Van Gogh make adjustment in the composition. As far as two years after Van Gogh completed this painting, he considered it his finest work. This painting has also been a main target for art thieves, who have stolen it not once, but twice times. An early version of the painting was stolen in 1988, but later returned with no ransom, and again in 1991, when it was abandoned by the thieves and recovered.~1885~82~114~Oil on canvas~Van Gogh Museum, Amsterdam~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Potato_Eaters
60~19~36~19050~Sunflowers~<em>Sunflowers</em> (original title, in French: Tournesols) are the subject of two series of still life paintings by the Dutch painter Vincent van Gogh. The earlier series executed in Paris in 1887 gives the flowers lying on the ground, while the second set executed a year later in Arles shows bouquets of sunflowers in a vase. In the artist's mind both sets were linked by the name of his friend Paul Gauguin, who acquired two of the Paris versions. About eight months later Van Gogh hoped to welcome and to impress Gauguin again with Sunflowers, now part of the painted décoration he prepared for the guestroom of his Yellow House where Gauguin was supposed to stay in Arles. After Gauguin's departure, Van Gogh imagined the two major versions as wings of the Berceuse Triptych, and finally he included them in his exhibit at Les XX in Bruxelles.~1888~92~73~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, London~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunflowers_(painting)
294~20~36~20010~Bathing At Asnieres~<em>Bathers at Asnières</em> (French: <em>Une Baignade, Asnières</em>) is an oil-on-canvas painting by the French artist Georges-Pierre Seurat, the first of his two masterpieces on the monumental scale. Seurat borrowed from sources such as those of the fresco painters of the 15th century, the French classicism of Nicolas Poussin, and of contemporary Impressionism to create a unified canvas of a suburban, but placid Parisian riverside scene. The isolated figures and their clothes piled sculpturally on the riverbank, together with the trees, and austere boundary walls and buildings, are presented in a formal layout. A combination of complex brushstroke techniques, and a meticulous application of contemporary colour theory bring to the composition a sense of gentle vibrancy and timelessness. Seurat was twenty-four years old when he painted <em>Bathers at Asnières</em>, and he was to live for just another seven years. The Bathers puzzled many of Seurat’s contemporaries, and the picture was not widely acclaimed during his lifetime. An appreciation of it grew, however, during the twentieth century, and today it hangs in the National Gallery, London, where it is considered one of the highlights of the gallery’s collection of paintings.~1883~201~300~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, London~$900.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bathers_at_Asni%C3%A8res
66~20~36~20040~A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatt~Seurat spent over two years painting <em>A Sunday Afternoon</em>, focusing meticulously on the landscape of the park. He reworked the original as well as completed numerous preliminary drawings and oil sketches. He would go and sit in the park and make numerous sketches of the various figures in order to perfect their form. He concentrated on the issues of colour, light, and form. Motivated by study in optical and colour theory, Seurat contrasted miniature dots of colors that, through optical unification, form a single hue in the viewer's eye. He believed that this form of painting, now known as pointillism, would make the colors more brilliant and powerful than standard brush strokes. To make the experience of the painting even more vivid, he surrounded it with a frame of painted dots, which in turn he enclosed with a pure white, wooden frame, which is how the painting is exhibited today at the Art Institute of Chicago. In creating the picture, Seurat employed the then-new pigment zinc yellow (zinc chromate), most visibly for yellow highlights on the lawn in the painting, but also in mixtures with orange and blue pigments. In the century and more since the painting's completion, the zinc yellow has darkened to brown—a colour degeneration that was already showing in the painting in Seurat's lifetime.~1884~208~308~Oil on canvas~Art Institute of Chicago~$550.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sunday_Afternoon_on_the_Island_of_La_Grande_Jatte
69~21~36~21020~Portrait of Madame Cézanne with Loosened Hair~<em>Portrait of Madame Cézanne with Loosened Hair</em> (or Madame Cézanne with Unbound Hair) is an oil-on-canvas painting by French artist Paul Cézanne, variously dated from the mid 1870s to the early 1890s. Although the model, his wife Hortense Fiquet, was not supportive and did not understand or take an interest her husband's work, this is one of forty-four portraits in which she sat for him from 1869, a period during which she progressed from mistress, to wife, to ex-wife. Something of a socialite, Cézanne latterly found Fiquet often fickle and shallow, and once remarked, "My wife only cares for Switzerland and lemonade". The sensitivity and depth ascribed to her in this work, is likely drawn from his own personality, projected onto her image.~1869~62~51~Oil on canvas~Philadelphia Museum of Art~$280.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Madame_C%C3%A9zanne_with_Loosened_Hair
70~21~36~21070~Card Players~<em>The Card Players</em> is a series of oil paintings from the French Post-Impressionist artist Paul Cézanne. Painted during Cézanne's final period in the early 1890s, there are five paintings in the series. The versions vary in size and in the number of players depicted. The series is considered by critics to be a cornerstone of Cézanne's work during the early-to-mid 1890s period, as well as a "prelude" to his final years, when he painted some of his most acclaimed work. Each painting depicts Provençal peasants immersed in smoking their pipes and playing cards. The subjects, all male, are displayed as studious within their card playing, eyes cast downward, intent on the game at hand. Cézanne adapted a motif from 17th century Dutch and French genre painting which often depicted card games with rowdy, drunken gamblers in taverns, replacing them instead with stone-faced tradesmen in a more simplified setting. Whereas previous paintings of the genre had illustrated heightened moments of drama, Cézanne's portraits have been noted for their lack of drama, narrative, and conventional characterization. Other than an unused wine bottle in the two-player versions, there is an absence of drink and money, which were prominent fixtures of the 17th century genre. A painting by one of the Le Nain brothers depicting card players at a museum in Aix-en-Provence, near the artist's residence, is widely believed to have been an inspiration for Cézanne.~1890~134~182~Oil on canvas~The Barnes Foundation, Merion, Pennsylvania~$275.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Card_Players
71~21~36~21060~Still Life With Apples~Throughout his life, the French painter Paul Cézanne returned again and again to the still life. Encompassing small—scale domestic scenes rather than grand public ones, still life was considered the lowliest of genres by the French Royal Academy, the official arbiter of great art in the nineteenth century. Yet in <em>Still Life with Apples</em>, Cézanne proved that this modest genre could be a vehicle for thinking through the Impressionist project of faithfully representing the appearance of light and space. "Painting from nature is not copying the object," he wrote, "it is realizing one's sensations."~1890~69~93~Oil on canvas~The Museum of Modern Art, New York~$300.00~http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=78486
68~21~36~21010~Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from Bellevue~<em>Mont Sainte-Victoire seen from Bellevue</em> is a landscape painting dating from around 1885, by the French artist Paul Cézanne. The subject of the painting is the Montagne Sainte-Victoire in Provence in southern France. Cézanne spent a lot of time in Aix-en-Provence at the time, and developed a special relationship with the landscape. This particular mountain, that stood out in the surrounding landscape, he could see from his house, and he painted it in on numerous occasions. The painting shows clearly Cézanne's project of rendering order and clarity to natural scenes, without giving up the optical realism of Impressionism. Both the light and the colours of the painting give the impression of a pattern that is not imposed on nature, but is there naturally.~1885~73~92~Oil on canvas~Barnes Foundation, Pennsylvania~$300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mont_Sainte-Victoire_seen_from_Bellevue
299~21~36~21030~Portrait of Uncle Dominique, as a Monk~In the fall of 1866 Cézanne painted nine portraits of his maternal uncle, Dominique Aubert. The forty-nine-year-old bailiff indulged his nephew with multiple sittings and agreed to pose in various costumes. Whereas he is shown here in the habit of a Dominican monk, in another likeness of this date, also in the Metropolitan's collection, he wears a tassled cap and robe.~1866~65~55~Oil on canvas~The Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York~$280.00~http://www.metmuseum.org/collections/search-the-collections/110000302
300~21~36~21040~The Basket of Apples~<em>The Basket of Apples</em> is a still life oil painting noted for its disjointed perspective. It has been described as a balanced composition due to its unbalanced parts; the tilted bottle, the incline of the basket, and the foreshortened lines of the cookies meshing with the lines of the tablecloth. Additionally, the right side of the tabletop is not in the same plane as the left side, as if the image simultaneously reflects two viewpoints. Paintings such as this helped form a bridge between Impressionism and Cubism.~1895~65~80~Oil on canvas~Art Institute of Chicago, Chicago~$275.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Basket_of_Apples
301~21~36~21050~Large Bathers~<em>The Large Bathers</em> (French: <em>Les Grandes Baigneuses</em>) is an oil painting by French artist Paul Cézanne first exhibited in 1906. The painting is the largest of a series of "Bather" paintings by Cézanne; the others are in the Museum of Modern Art in New York City and the National Gallery, London. Occasionally referred to as the Big Bathers or Large Bathers to distinguish it from the smaller works, the painting is considered one of the masterpieces of modern art, and is often considered Cézanne's finest work. Cézanne worked on the painting for seven years, and it remained unfinished at the time of his death in 1906. The painting was purchased in 1937 for $110,000 with funds from a trust fund for the Philadelphia Museum of Art by their major benefactor Joseph E. Widener. It was previously owned by Leo Stein. The abstract nude females present in <em>Large Bathers</em> give the painting tension and density. It is exceptional among his work in symmetrical dimensions, with the adaption of the nude forms to the triangular pattern of the trees and river. Using the same technique as employed in painting landscapes and still lifes, <em>Large Bathers</em> is reminiscent of the work of Titian and Peter Paul Rubens. Comparisons are also often made with the other famous group of nude women of the same period, Picasso's <em>Les Demoiselles d'Avignon</em>.~1899~208~249~Oil on canvas~Philadelphia Museum of Art~$375.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Bathers_(C%C3%A9zanne)
81~24~56~24050~Madonna~<em>Madonna</em> is a painting by the Norwegian expressionist Edvard Munch. Munch painted five versions of the Madonna between 1894 and 1895, using oils on canvas. Although it is a highly unusual representation, nevertheless, this painting is of Mary, the mother of Jesus. True to the Norwegian cultural beliefs and way of life, the painting is a strong dose of conceivable realism.~1895~91~70~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, Oslo~$230.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_(Edvard_Munch)
80~24~56~24040~Puberty~<em>Puberty</em> is a painting created by Edvard Munch. Munch is an artist native to Norway and is widely known for his role in expressionistic art. Puberty has also been done as a lithograph and an etching by Munch. Upon observation of Puberty one of the strongest points in the piece to most is first the adolescent female who is placed mid-center of the painting. The second almost 'haunting' point in this painting is the shadow the female is meant to be casting. It has been speculated, because of the current sexual mind Munch was in during the time in which he painted this, that the shadow may be a hovering male genital. The thought of male genitalia to a young woman during this time of her own rapidly changing body creates a stench of tension within the piece. Another thought on the shadow is that it suggests the symbolic meaning of death. Both of these speculations on the shadow in this piece reflect well upon what Munch is known for symbolically portraying in his artwork. The female in Puberty had originally been thought to have been a model of Munch's while he was in Berlin. The strong detail used in the collar bones of her body suggests that he very well might have used a model. Either way this young lady is trapped in a space that alludes to much controversy within her mind and surroundings.~1894~152~110~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, Oslo~$165.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Puberty_(Edvard_Munch)
79~24~56~24030~Cry (The Scream)~<em>Scream,/em> (Norwegian: Skrik; created in 1893–1910) is the title of expressionist paintings and prints in a series by Norwegian artist Edvard Munch, showing an agonized figure against a blood red sky. The landscape in the background is the Oslofjord, viewed from the hill of Ekeberg, in Oslo (then Kristiania), Norway. Edvard Munch created several versions of Scream in various media. The Munch Museum holds one of two painted versions (1910, see gallery) and one pastel. The National Gallery of Norway holds the other painted version (1893, shown to right). A fourth version, in pastel, is owned by Norwegian businessman Petter Olsen. Munch also created a lithograph of the image in 1895. Scream has been the target of several high-profile art thefts. In 1994, the version in the National Gallery was stolen. It was recovered several months later. In 2004, The Scream and Madonna were stolen from the Munch Museum. Both paintings were recovered in 2006. They had sustained some damage and went back on display in May 2008, after undergoing restoration.~1893~91~74~Oil, tempera and pastel on cardboard~National Gallery, Oslo~$225.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Scream
192~29~56~29010~The Kiss~<em>The Kiss</em> (original <em>Der Kuss</em>) was painted by Gustav Klimt, and is probably his most famous work. He began work on it in 1907 and it is the highpoint of his so-called 'Golden Period', when he painted a number of works in a similar style. It depicts a couple embracing, their bodies largely hidden by elaborate robes decorated in a style that bears little relation to any historical textile designs. As well as conventional oil paint, gold leaf has been used, one of the aspects of the work that gives it a strikingly modern appearance, while evoking memories of much earlier art. The painting is now in the Österreichische Galerie Belvedere museum, in the Belvedere palace, in Vienna, Austria. When he painted The Kiss Klimt was 45 and still lived at home with his mother and two unmarried sisters - but behind the respectable facade he was a man with a ferocious sexual appetite. Klimt fathered at least three illegitimate children and probably many more. He was obsessed by women and he had a fixation with redheads. It is no surprise that the woman in The Kiss has red hair. According to writer Frank Whitford: "Together the man and the woman form the shape of a penis and I think that is intentional - it's about sex and about the fulfillment of sex between a man and a woman."~1907~180~180~Oil and gold on canvas~Osterreichische Galerie, Vienna~$320.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Kiss_(Klimt_painting)
353~29~56~29030~Danae~This painting is a typical representation of Klimt’s stylized eroticism, and portrays the subject of Danae, which has been a popular theme throughout painting, having been painted before by Corregio, Rembrandt, and Titian. Danae was the symbol of divine love, transcendence, and sensational beauty. By positioning the model with a raised leg, this painting pays tribute to the Titian series of paintings by the same name. As the story goes, while Danae was imprisoned by her father, she was visited by Zeus, in the form of the golden rain flowing between her legs. Soon after Zeus’ visit, Danae became pregnant and gave birth to her son Perseus.~1908~77~83~Oil on canvas~Galerie Wurthle, Vienna~$320.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dana%C3%AB_(Klimt_painting)
354~29~56~29040~Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I~This painting, which took three years to complete, was commissioned by the wealthy industrialist Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer, who made his money in the sugar industry. Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer favored the arts, especially Klimt, and commissioned him to complete another portrait of his wife Adele in 1912. Adele Bloch-Bauer was the only person to be painted twice by Klimt. This painting is perhaps most famous not for its artistic quality, but because of its scandalous history since inception. Upon her death, Adele Bloch-Bauer wished the painting to be given to the Austrian State Gallery, but it was seized by advancing German forces in World War II. In 1945, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer designated the paintings to be the property of his nephew and nieces, including Maria Altmann. Nonetheless, the Austrian government retained ownership of the painting, and was not returned to the Altmann family until 2006 after a long court battle. The painting was then sold at auction for $135 dollars, which is said to be the highest price paid at auction for a painting. It is now displayed the Neue Art Gallery in New York.~1907~138~138~Oil, silver, and gold on canvas~Neue Galerie, New York~$5000.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adele_Bloch-Bauer_I
214~45~47~45040~Metamorphosis of Narcissus~This painting is from Dalí's Paranoiac-critical period. According to Greek mythology, Narcissus fell in love with his own reflection in a pool. Unable to embrace the watery image, he pined away, and the gods immortalized him as a flower. Dali completed this painting in 1937 on his long awaited return to Paris after having had great success in the United States.~1937~51~78~Oil on canvas~Tate Modern, London~$350.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metamorphosis_of_Narcissus
213~45~47~45030~Soft Construction with Boiled Beans~Depicted is a grimacing dismembered figure symbolic of the Spanish state in civil war, alternately grasping upward at itself and holding itself down underfoot, a relationship morbidly prescient of Escher's later <em>Drawing Hands</em> (1948). The painting resides at the Philadelphia Museum of Art. The painting, which was painted in 1936, is used to show the struggle of war that can sometimes be both self-fulfilling and self-mutilating at the same time. Despite his support of General Franco, Dalí was openly against war, and used this painting to show it. The boiled beans may refer to the ancient Catalan offering to the gods. The little man in the bottom left corner is a representation of the astonishing, awe-inspiring spirits contained in the souls of Anneke and Nikki van Lugo, childhood friends and muses of Dalí.~1936~100~99~Oil on canvas~Philadelphia Museum of Art, Philadelphia~$340.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soft_Construction_with_Boiled_Beans_(Premonition_of_Civil_War)
124~45~47~45020~Persistence of Memory~<em>The Persistence of Memory</em> is by far Salvador Dali’s most recognizable paintings, and there are many references to it in popular culture. Although it was conjectured that the soft melting watches were the result of Dali’s interpretation of the theory of relativity, Dali himself state that their inspiration was camembert cheese melting under the sun. The sequence of melting clocks in a disjointed landscape is the depiction of a dream that Dali had experienced, the figure in the middle of the painting being the face of the dreamer himself. The general interpretation is that the painting, which portrays many melting watches, is a rejection of time as a solid and deterministic influence.~1931~24~33~Oil on canvas~The Museum of Modern Arts, New York~$260.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Persistence_of_Memory
358~45~47~45050~The Discovery of America by Christopher Columbus~This work is an ambitious homage to Dali's Spain. It combines Spanish history, religion, art, and myth into a unified whole. It was commissioned for Huntington Hartford for the opening of his Museum Gallery of Modern Art on Columbus Circle (hence the mention in the Title) in New York. At this time, some Catalan historians were claiming that Columbus was actually from Catalonia, not Italy, making the discovery all the more relevant for Dali, who was also from this region of Spain.~1958~410~284~Oil on canvas~Salvador Dalí Museum, St. Petersburg, Florida~$1050.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Discovery_of_America_by_Christopher_Columbus
212~45~47~45010~The Ghost of Vermeer van Delft which Can Be Used as a Table~The title refers to the Dutch painter Johannes Vermeer and the image of Vermeer viewed from his back is a reference to Vermeer's painting <em>The Art of Painting</em>. In this image Vermeer is represented as a dark spindly figure in a kneeling position. The figure’s outstretched leg serves as a table top surface, on which sits a bottle and a small glass. This leg tapers to a baluster-like stub, however there is a shoe nearby. One wrist of the Vermeer figure rests on a crutch-like support. Images of anthropomorphic furniture as well as crutch-like objects are common in this period of Dalí’s career.~1934~24~18~Oil on wood~Salvador Dali Museum, St. Petersburg, Florida~$110.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Ghost_of_Vermeer_of_Delft_Which_Can_Be_Used_As_a_Table
232~63~47~63020~Sleeping Gypsy~Rousseau described the subject of <em>The Sleeping Gypsy</em>: “A wandering Negress, a mandolin player, lies with her jar beside her (a vase with drinking water), overcome by fatigue in a deep sleep. A lion chances to pass by, picks up her scent yet does not devour her. There is a moonlight effect, very poetic.” A toll collector for the city of Paris, Rousseau was a largely self-taught painter, although he had ambitions of entering the Academy. This goal was never realized, but his sharp colors, fantastic imagery, and precise outlines—derived from the style and subject matter of popular print culture— struck a chord with a younger generation of avant-garde painters, including Pablo Picasso, Vasily Kandinsky, and Frida Kahlo.~1897~130~201~Oil on canvas~The Museum of Modern Art, New York~$950.00~http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=80172
231~63~47~63010~Dream~Although Rousseau completed more than twenty-five jungle paintings in his career, he never traveled outside France. He instead drew on images of the exotic as it was presented to the urban dweller through popular literature, colonial expositions, and the Paris Zoo. The lush jungle, wild animals, and mysterious horn player featured in this work were inspired by Rousseau's visits to the city's natural history museum and Jardin des plantes (a combined zoo and botanical garden). Of his visits the artist said, "When I am in these hothouses and see the strange plants from exotic lands, it seems to me that I am entering a dream." The nude model in this painting reclines on a sofa, mixing the domestic and the exotic.~1910~204~298~Oil on canvas~The Museum of Modern Art, New York~$975.00~http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?object_id=79277
362~91~78~091010~Expulsion from the Garden of Eden~The <em>Expulsion from the Garden of Eden</em>  is a fresco by the Italian Early Renaissance artist Masaccio. The fresco is a single scene from the cycle painted around 1425 by Masaccio, Masolino and others on the walls of the Brancacci Chapel in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Florence. It depicts the expulsion of Adam and Eve from the garden of Eden, from the biblical Book of Genesis chapter 3, albeit with a few differences from the canonical account.~1425~~~Fresco~Brancacci Chapel, Florence~$440.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expulsion_from_the_Garden_of_Eden
363~91~78~091020~Tribute Money~The <em>Tribute Money</em> is a fresco by the Italian renaissance painter Masaccio, located in the Brancacci Chapel of the basilica of Santa Maria del Carmine, Florence, and completed by his senior collaborator, Masolino. Painted in the 1420s, it is widely considered among Masaccio's best work, and a vital part of the development of renaissance art. The painting is part of a cycle on the life of Saint Peter, and describes a scene from the Gospel of Matthew, in which Jesus directs Peter to find a coin in the mouth of a fish in order to pay the temple tax. It owes its importance in particular to its revolutionary use of perspective and chiaroscuro.~1425~~~Fresco~Brancacci Chapel, Florence~$640.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Tribute_Money_(Masaccio)
364~91~78~091030~Holy Trinity~The <em>Holy Trinity</em>, with the Virgin and Saint John and donors (Italian: Santa Trinità ) is a fresco by the Early Italian Renaissance painter Masaccio. It is located in the Dominican church of Santa Maria Novella, in Florence. It is thought to have been created by Masaccio sometime between 1425-1427. He died in late 1428 at the age of 26, or having just turned 27, leaving behind a relatively small body of work. This painting was one of his last major commissions, and is considered to be one of his masterpieces.~1428~667~317~Fresco~Santa Maria Novella, Florence~$900.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holy_Trinity_(Masaccio)
365~91~78~091040~Madonna and Child~The <em>Madonna and Child with Angels</em> is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Masaccio, who worked in collaboration with his brother Giovanni and with Andrea di Giusto. The painting is the central panel of the Pisa Altarpiece, a large multi-paneled altarpiece executed for the chapel of St. Julian, owned by the notary Giuliano di Colino in the church of Santa Maria del Carmine in Pisa. The painting is in a very damaged state, the altarpiece having been cut up and sold in pieces long ago. Today the panel is smaller than its original state; it has lost perhaps as much as 8 cm. at the bottom and 2-2.5 cm. at each side. Eleven surviving panels of the altarpiece, which is the only documented work by Masaccio, are in various museums.~1426~136~73~Tempera on panel~National Gallery, London~$720.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Madonna_and_Child_(Masaccio)
369~92~78~092040~Adoration in the Forest~<em>Adoration in the Forest</em> is a painting completed before 1459 by the Carmelite friar, Filippo Lippi, of the Virgin Mary and the newly born Christ Child lying on the ground, in the unusual setting of a steep, dark, wooded wilderness. There are no shepherds, kings, ox, ass – there is no Joseph. It was painted for one of the wealthiest men in Renaissance Florence, the banker Cosimo de Medici. In later times it had a turbulent history. Hitler ordered it to be hidden in WW2 and it became part of the story of a mutiny in the U.S. Army.~1459~1185~1295~Oil on wood~Gemäldegalerie, Berlin~$1600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoration_in_the_Forest_(Lippi)
366~92~78~092010~Madonna and Child~<em>Madonna with Child</em> is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Filippo Lippi, executed around 1465. It is one of the few works by Lippi which was not executed with the help of his workshop and was an influential model for later depictions of the Madonna and Child, including those by Sandro Botticelli.~1465~95~64~Tempera on panel~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_and_Child_(Fra_Lippo_Lippi)
367~92~78~092020~Annunciation~The <em>Annunciation</em> is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Filippo Lippi, finished around 1443-1450. It depicts the Virgin humbly accepting her role as mother of Jesus, with a hand on her breast, while the dove, symbol of the Holy Spirit, is given to her. The angel is kneeling next to her, also with a hand on his breast a greeting sign. The scene is framed into a portico opening to a close garden.~1450~203~186~Oil on panel~Alte Pinakothek, Munich~$450.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_(Lippi,_Munich)
368~92~78~092030~Coronation of the Virgin~The <em>Coronation of the Virgin</em> (in Italian Incoronazione Maringhi) is a painting of the Coronation of the Virgin by the Italian Renaissance master Filippo Lippi, in the Uffizi, Florence.~1447~200~287~Tempera on wood~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronation_of_the_Virgin_(Filippo_Lippi)
371~93~78~093020~Flagellation of Christ~The <em>Flagellation of Christ</em> is a painting by Piero della Francesca in the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche in Urbino, Italy. Called by one writer an "enigmatic little painting," the composition is complex and unusual, and its iconography has been the subject of widely differing theories. Kenneth Clark placed The Flagellation in his personal list of the best ten paintings, calling it 'the greatest small painting in the world'.~1455~58~81~Oil and tempera on panel~Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, Urbino~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Flagellation_of_Christ_(Piero_della_Francesca)
372~93~78~093030~The Resurrection~The <em>Resurrection</em> is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance master Piero della Francesca, painted around 1463-65. Though documentation is lacking, the gothic Residenza, the communal meeting hall in which it was painted, was returned by Florentine authorities to the citizens of Sansepolcro, Tuscany, 1 February 1459, as a sign of the restoration of some measure of autonomy to the Borgo; today the civic structure houses the Museo Civico of Sansepolcro, the artist's hometown. Now placed high on the interior wall facing the entrance, the fresco has for its subject an allusion to the name of the city (meaning "Holy Sepulchre"), derived from the presence of two relics of the Holy Sepulchre carried by two pilgrims in the 9th century. Piero's Christ is also present on the town's Coat of Arms.~1460~225~200~Fresco~Museo Civico, Sansepolcro~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection_(Piero_della_Francesca)
370~93~78~093010~Baptism of Christ~The <em>Baptism of Christ</em> was commissioned presumably some time about 1440 by the Camaldolese Monastery of Sansepolcro in Tuscany, originally part of a triptych. Its dating to Piero della Francesca's early career is evidenced by the strong relationship with the "light painting" of his master, Domenico Veneziano. It portrays Christ being baptised by John, his head surmounted by a dove representing the Holy Spirit. Christ, John's hand, the bird and the bowl form an axis which divides the painting in two symmetrical parts. A second division is created by the tree on the left, which instead divides it according to the golden ratio.~1450~167~116~Tempera on panel~National Gallery, London~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baptism_of_Christ_(Piero_della_Francesca)
375~94~78~094030~Presentation at the Temple~The <em>Presentation at the Temple</em> is painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna. Dating to c. 1455, it is housed in the Gemäldegalerie, Berlin, Germany. The date of the painting is unknown, but it belongs to the painter's youth in Padua. Date ranges from 1453, when Mantegna married Nicolosia Bellini, daughter of painter Giovanni, and 1460 when he left for Mantua. Bellini's Presentation at the Temple, explicitly inspired by Mantegna's, dates to around the latter year.~1455~69~86~Tempera on canvas~Gemäldegalerie, Berlin~$900.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Presentation_at_the_Temple_(Mantegna)
373~94~78~094010~Lamentation of Christ~The <em>Lamentation of Christ</em> is a painting of about 1480 by the Italian Renaissance artist Andrea Mantegna. While the dating of the piece is debated, it was completed between 1475 and 1501, probably in the early 1480s. It portrays the body Christ supine on a marble slab. He is watched over by the Virgin Mary and Saint John whose cut-off profile is behind the Virgin Mary, who are weeping for his death.~1480~68~81~Tempera on canvas~Pinacoteca di Brera, Milan~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Lamentation_over_the_Dead_Christ_(Mantegna)
374~94~78~094020~St. Sebastian~<em>St. Sebastian</em> is the subject of three paintings by the Italian Early Renaissance master Andrea Mantegna. The Paduan artist lived in a period of frequent plagues; Sebastian was considered protector against the plague as having been shot through by arrows, and it was thought that plague spread abroad through the air.~1457~300~680~Oil on panel~Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna~$1200.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Sebastian_of_Vienna_(Mantegna)
376~95~78~095010~Primavera~<em>Primavera</em>, also known as Allegory of Spring, is a tempera panel painting by Italian Renaissance artist Sandro Botticelli. Painted ca. 1482, the painting is described in Culture & Values (2009) as "[o]ne of the most popular paintings in Western art". It is also "one of the most written about, and most controversial paintings in the world." While most critics agree that the painting, depicting a group of mythological figures in a garden, is allegorical for the lush growth of Spring, other meanings have also been explored. Among them, the work is sometimes cited as illustrating the ideal of Neoplatonic love. The painting itself carries no title and was first called La Primavera by the art historian Giorgio Vasari who saw it at Villa Castello, just outside Florence, in 1550.~1482~202~314~Tempera on panel~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Primavera_(Painting)
377~95~78~095020~The Birth of Venus~The <em>Birth of Venus</em> is a 1486 painting by Sandro Botticelli. Botticelli was commissioned to paint the work by the Medici family of Florence, specifically Lorenzo di Pierfrancesco de' Medici under the influence of his cousin Lorenzo de' Medici, close friend to Botticelli . It depicts the goddess Venus, having emerged from the sea as a fully grown woman, arriving at the sea-shore (which is related to the Venus Anadyomene motif).The painting is on display at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence, Italy.~1486~172~278~Tempera on canvas~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Birth_of_Venus_(Botticelli)
378~95~78~095030~Venus and Mars~<em>Venus and Mars</em> is a c. 1483 painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli. It shows the Roman gods Venus and Mars in an allegory of Beauty and Valour. Venus watches Mars sleep while two infant satyrs play carrying his armour as another rests under his arm. A fourth blows a small conch shell in his ear in an effort to wake him. The scene is set in a forest, and the background shows, in the distance, the sea from which Venus emerged. A swarm of wasps hover around Mars' head, possibly as a symbol that love is often accompanied by pain. Another possible explanation is that the wasps represent the Vespucci family that may have commissioned the painting; the symbol of the Vespucci house is the wasp. The painting is thought originally to have been the back of a lettuccio, a wooden sofa.~1483~69~173~Tempera on panel~National Gallery, London~$1000.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_and_Mars_(Botticelli)
379~95~78~095040~The Mystical Nativity~The <em>Mystical Nativity</em> is a painting of circa 1500–1501 by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, in the National Gallery in London. Botticelli built up the image using oil paint on canvas. It is his only signed work, and has a very unusual iconography for a Nativity. It has been suggested that the painting may be connected with the influence of Savonarola, whose influence appears in a number of late paintings by Botticelli, though the contents of the image may have been specified by the person commissioning it.~1500~108~75~Tempera on canvas~National Gallery, London~$1075.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mystical_Nativity
380~95~78~095050~Adoration of the Magi~The <em>Adoration of the Magi</em> is a painting by the Italian Renaissance master Sandro Botticelli, dating from 1475 or 1476. It is housed in the Uffizi of Florence. Botticelli was commissioned to paint at least seven versions of The Adoration of the Magi. The Adoration of the Magi theme was popular in the Renaissance Florence. The work was commissioned by Gaspare di Zanobi del Lama, a banker of humble origins and dubious morality connected to the House of Medici, for his chapel in the church of Santa Maria Novella (now destroyed). In the scene are present numerous characters among which are several members of the Medici family: Cosimo de' Medici (the Magus kneeling in front of the Virgin, described by Vasari as "the finest of all that are now extant for its life and vigour"), his sons Piero (the second Magus kneeling in the centre with the red mantle) and Giovanni (the third Magus), and his grandsons Giuliano and Lorenzo. The three Medici portrayed as Magi were all dead at the time the picture was painted, and Florence was effectively ruled by Lorenzo.~1475~111~134~Tempera on panel~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adoration_of_the_Magi_of_1475_(Botticelli)
382~96~78~096020~Madonna in Glory with the Child and Saints~The <em>Madonna in Glory with Saints<em> is a painting by the Italian Renaissance painter Pietro Perugino, dating to c. 1500-1501. It is housed in the Pinacoteca Nazionale of Bologna, Italy. It was originally located in the Scarani Chapel of the church of San Giovanni in Monte. The scheme of the composition, typical of Perugino's mature works (based on the lost Assumption of the Sistine Chapel and used in numerous works of the period, such as the San Francesco al Prato Resurrection and the Vallombrosa Altarpiece), includes two different levels. The Madonna with Child, depicted within an almond in the upper part; and a group of four saints above a hilly landscape in the lower one.~1500~330~265~Oil on panel~Pinacoteca Nazionale di Bologna~$850.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_in_Glory_with_Saints
383~96~78~096030~Portrait of Francesco delle Opere~The <em>Portrait of Francesco delle Opere</em> is a painting by the Italian Renaissance artist Perugino, dating to 1494 and housed in the Uffizi Gallery, Florence. Francesco delle Opere is portrayed from three-quarters, with a black beret and a mantle of the same color, a red blouse under which is a white shirt. His hand holds a cartouche with the words Timete Devm ("Beware of God"), the beginning of a famous preaching by Girolamo Savonarola. The hands lie on an invisible parapet which coincides with the painting's lower border, as in Flemish contemporary works such as Hans Memling's Man with a Letter.~1494~52~44~Oil on panel~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$500.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Francesco_delle_Opere
381~96~78~096010~Delivery of the Keys~The <em>Delivery of the Keys</em>, or Christ Giving the Keys to St. Peter is a fresco by the Italian Renaissance painter Pietro Perugino, executed in 1481-1482 and located in the Sistine Chapel, Rome. The scene, part of the series of the Stories of Jesus on the chapel's northern wall, is a reference to Matthew 16 in which the "keys of the kingdom of heaven" are given to St.Peter. These keys represent the power to forgive and to share the word of God thereby giving them the power to allow others into heaven.~1481~330~550~Fresco~Sistine Chapel, Rome~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Delivery_of_the_Keys_(Perugino)
386~97~79~097020~Annunciation~This is a painting of the traditional subject of the <em>Annunciation</em>, by the Italian Renaissance artists Leonardo da Vinci and Andrea del Verrocchio, dating from circa 1472–1475[1] and housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy. The angel holds a Madonna lily, a symbol of Mary's virginity and of the city of Florence. It is supposed that Leonardo originally copied the wings from those of a bird in flight, but they have since been lengthened by a later artist.~1472~98~217~Oil and tempera on panel~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$620.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Annunciation_(Leonardo)
387~97~79~097030~Ginevra de' Benci~Ginevra de’ Benci was an aristocrat from 15th-century Florence, admired for her intelligence by Florentine contemporaries. She is the subject of a portrait painting by Leonardo da Vinci. The oil-on-wood portrait was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in Washington, D.C., in 1967, for US$5 million paid to the Princely House of Liechtenstein, a record price at the time, from the Ailsa Mellon Bruce Fund. It is the only painting by Leonardo on public view in the Americas.~1474~38~37~Oil on panel~National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.~$400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ginevra_de%27_Benci
388~97~79~097040~The Virgin and Child with St. Anne~<em>The Virgin and Child with Saint Anne</em> is an oil painting by Leonardo da Vinci depicting St. Anne, her daughter the Virgin Mary and the infant Jesus. Christ is shown grappling with a sacrificial lamb symbolizing his Passion as the Virgin tries to restrain him. The painting was commissioned as the high altarpiece for the Church of Santissima Annunziata in Florence and its theme had long preoccupied Leonardo.~1508~168~112~Oil on wood~Louvre, Paris~$550.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Virgin_and_Child_with_St._Anne_(Leonardo_da_Vinci)
389~97~79~097050~Mona Lisa~The <em>Mona Lisa</em> (or <em>La Gioconda</em>) is a half-length portrait of a woman by the Italian artist Leonardo da Vinci, which has been acclaimed as "the best known, the most visited, the most written about, the most sung about, the most parodied work of art in the world." The painting, thought to be a portrait of Lisa Gherardini, the wife of Francesco del Giocondo, is in oil on a poplar panel, and is believed to have been painted between 1503 and 1506. It was acquired by King Francis I of France and is now the property of the French Republic, on permanent display at the Musée du Louvre in Paris since 1797. The ambiguity of the subject's expression, which is frequently described as enigmatic, the monumentality of the composition, the subtle modeling of forms and the atmospheric illusionism were novel qualities that have contributed to the continuing fascination and study of the work.~1503~77~53~Oil on wood~Louvre, Paris~$450.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mona_Lisa
390~97~79~097060~St. John the Baptist~<em>St. John the Baptist</em> is an oil painting on walnut wood by Leonardo da Vinci. Completed from 1513 to 1516, when the High Renaissance was metamorphosing into Mannerism, it is believed to be his last painting. The original size of the work was 69x57 cm. It is now exhibited at the Musée du Louvre in Paris, France. The piece depicts St. John the Baptist in isolation. St. John is dressed in pelts, has long curly hair, and is smiling in an enigmatic manner which is reminiscent of Leonardo's famous Mona Lisa. He holds a reed cross in his left hand while his right hand points up toward heaven (like St Anne in Leonardo's cartoon The Virgin and Child with St Anne and St John the Baptist). It is believed that the cross and wool skins were added at a later date by another painter.~1518~69~57~Oil on wood~Louvre, Paris~$560.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._John_the_Baptist_(Leonardo)
384~97~79~097010~Virgin of the Rocks~The <em>Virgin of the Rocks</em> (sometimes the Madonna of the Rocks) is the name used for two paintings by Leonardo da Vinci, of the same subject, and of a composition which is identical except for several significant details. The version generally considered the prime version, that is the earlier of the two, hangs in the Musée du Louvre in Paris and the other in the National Gallery, London. The paintings are both nearly 2 metres (over 6 feet) high and are painted in oils. Both were painted on wooden panel; that in the Louvre has been transferred to canvas. Both paintings show the Madonna and Christ Child with the infant John the Baptist and an angel, in a rocky setting which gives the paintings their usual name. The significant compositional differences are in the gaze and right hand of the angel. There are many minor ways in which the works differ, including the colours, the lighting, the flora, and the way in which sfumato has been used. Although the date of an associated commission is documented, the complete histories of the two paintings are unknown, and lead to speculation about which of the two is earlier.~1505~190~120~Oil on panel~National Gallery, London~$670.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virgin_of_the_Rocks
392~98~79~098020~The Creation of Adam~<em>The Creation of Adam</em> is arguably the most famous section of Michelangelo's fresco Sistine Chapel ceiling painted circa 1511–1512. It is traditionally thought to illustrate the Biblical creation narrative from the Book of Genesis in which God breathes life into Adam, the first man. Chronologically the fourth in the series of panels depicting episodes from Genesis on the Sistine ceiling, it was among the last to be completed. It is the most well-known of the Sistine Chapel fresco panels, and its fame as a piece of art is rivaled only by the Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci. The image of the near-touching hands of God and Adam has become one of the single most iconic images of humanity and has been reproduced in countless imitations and parodies. Along with Leonardo da Vinci's The Last Supper, The Creation of Adam and the other Sistine Chapel panels are the most replicated religious paintings of all time.~1512~480~230~Fresco~Sistine Chapel, Rome~$1400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Creation_of_Adam
393~98~79~098030~Libyan Sibyl~On the five pendentives along each side of the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel and the two at either end, Michelangelo painted the largest figures on the ceiling: twelve people who prophesied or represented some aspect of the Coming of Christ. Of those twelve, seven were Prophets of Israel and were male. The remaining five were prophets of the Classical World, called Sibyls and were female. The <em>Libyan Sibyl</em>, named Phemonoe, was the prophetic priestess presiding over the Zeus Ammon Oracle (Zeus represented with the horns of Ammon) at Siwa Oasis in the Libyan Desert.~1510~395~380~Fresco~Sistine Chapel, Rome~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Libyan_Sibyl
391~98~79~098010~Doni Tondo~The <em>Doni Tondo</em>, sometimes called The Holy Family, is the only finished panel painting by the mature Michelangelo to survive. Now in the Uffizi in Florence, Italy, and still in its original frame, the painting was probably commissioned by Agnolo Doni to commemorate his marriage to Maddalena Strozzi, the daughter of a powerful Tuscan family. The painting is in the form of a tondo, or round frame, which is frequently associated during the Renaissance with domestic ideas. The work was most likely created during the period after the Doni's marriage in 1503 or 1504, as well as after the excavation of the Laocoön about 1506, yet before the Sistine Chapel ceiling frescoes were begun in 1508, dating the painting to approximately late 1506 or 1507. The Doni Tondo features the Christian Holy family (the child Jesus, Mary, and Saint Joseph) along with John the Baptist in the foreground and contains five ambiguous nude male figures in the background. The inclusion of these nude figures has been interpreted in a variety of ways.~1507~120~120~Oil and tempera on panel~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$700.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doni_Tondo
401~99~79~099080~Sistine Madonna~<em>Sistine Madonna</em> is an oil painting by the Italian artist Raphael. Commissioned in 1512 by Pope Julius II as an altarpiece for the church of San Sisto, Piacenza, it was one of the last Madonnas painted by the artist. Relocated to Dresden from 1754, the well-known painting has been particularly influential in Germany. After World War II, it was relocated to Moscow for a decade before it was returned to Germany. There, it resides as one of the central pieces in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister. The painting has been highly praised by many notable critics, and Giorgio Vasari called it a "a truly rare and extraordinary work".~1512~265~196~Oil on canvas~Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden~$1000.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sistine_Madonna
405~99~79~099120~Portrait of Bindo Altoviti~The <em>Portrait of Bindo Altoviti</em> is a painting finished around 1515 by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael. Bindo Altoviti was a rich banker born in Rome in 1491, but of Florentine origin. He was a cultured man who loved the arts. The graceful, almost effeminate position of the subject along with the heavy contrast between light and shadow are atypical of Raphael's work, particularly of his portraits of men, demonstrating the artist's experimentation with different styles and forms in his later Roman period. The influence of the works of Leonardo, which Raphael studied astutely during this period of his career, are strikingly evident in this particular piece.~1515~60~44~Oil on wood~National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.~$660.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Bindo_Altoviti_(Raphael)
404~99~79~099110~The Veiled Woman~The <em>Veiled Woman</em> or <em> La donna velata<em> is one of the most famous portraits by the Italian Renaissance painter Raphael. The subject of the painting appears in another portrait, La Fornarina, and is traditionally identified as the fornarina (bakeress) Margherita Luti, Raphael's Roman mistress.~1515~82~60~Oil on canvas~Palazzo Pitti, Florence~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_velata
394~99~79~099010~Madonna in the Meadow~The <em>Madonna of the Meadow</em> is also known as Madonna del prato. In it, the three figures in a calm green meadow are linked by looks and touching hands. The Virgin Mary is shown in a contrapposto pose, wearing a gold-bordered blue mantle set against a red dress and with her right leg lying along a diagonal. The blue symbolizes the church and the red Christ's death, with the Madonna the uniting of Mother Church with Christ's sacrifice. With her eyes fixed on Christ, her head is turned to the left and slightly inclined, and in her hands she holds up Christ, as he leans forward unsteadily to touch the miniature cross held by John. The poppy refers to Christ's passion, death and resurrection.~1505~113~88~Oil on wood~Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna~$450.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_of_the_meadow_(Raphael)
402~99~79~099090~The Triumph of Galatea~The <em>Triumph of Galatea</em> is a fresco masterpiece completed about 1514 by the Italian painter Raphael for the Villa Farnesina in Rome. The Farnesina was built for the Sienese banker Agostino Chigi, one of the richest men of that age. The Farnese family later acquired and renamed the villa, smaller than the more ostentatious palazzo at the other side of the Tiber. The fresco is a mythological scene of a series embellishing the open gallery of the building, a series never completed which was inspired to the "Stanze per la giostra" of the poet Angelo Poliziano. In Greek mythology, the beautiful Nereid Galatea had fallen in love with the peasant shepherd Acis. Her consort, one-eyed giant Polyphemus, after chancing upon the two lovers together, lobbed an enormous pillar and killed Acis.~1514~295~224~Fresco~Villa Farnesina, Rome~$1200.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galatea_(Raphael)
400~99~79~099070~The School of Athens~<em>The School of Athens</em> is one of the most famous frescoes by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael. It was painted between 1509 and 1511 as a part of Raphael's commission to decorate with frescoes the rooms now known as the Stanze di Raffaello, in the Apostolic Palace in the Vatican. The Stanza della Segnatura was the first of the rooms to be decorated, and The School of Athens the second painting to be finished there, after La Disputa, on the opposite wall. The picture has long been seen as "Raphael's masterpiece and the perfect embodiment of the classical spirit of the High Renaissance."~1510~500~770~Fresco~Apostolic Palace, Vatican City~$2000.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_School_of_Athens
399~99~79~099060~Alba Madonna~The <em>Alba Madonna</em> is a painting by the Italian High Renaissance artist Raphael, depicting Mary, Jesus and John the Baptist, in a typical Italian countryside. John the Baptist is holding up a cross to Jesus, which the baby Jesus is grasping. All three figures are staring at the cross. The three figures are grouped to the left in the round design, but the outstretched arm of the Madonna and the billowing material of her cloak balance the image.~1510~94~94~Oil transferred from wood to canvas~National Gallery of Art, Washington, D.C.~$700.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alba_Madonna
398~99~79~099050~Madonna of the Goldfinch~The <em>Madonna del cardellino</em> or <em>Madonna of the Goldfinch</em> is a painting by the Italian renaissance artist Raphael, from c. 1505-1506. A 10-year restoration process was completed in 2008, after which the painting was returned to its home at the Uffizi in Florence. In this painting, as in most of the Madonnas of his Florentine period, Raphael arranged the three figures - Mary, Christ and the young John the Baptist - to fit into a geometrical design. Though the positions of the three bodies are natural, together they form an almost regular triangle. The Madonna is shown young and beautiful, as with Raphael’s various other Madonnas. She is also clothed in red and blue, also typical, for red signifies the passion of Christ and blue was used to signify the church. Christ and John are still very young, only babies. John holds a goldfinch in his hand, and Christ is reaching out to touch it. The background is one typical of Raphael. The natural setting is diverse and yet all calmly frames the central subject taking place.~1505~107~77~Oil on wood~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$540.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_del_cardellino
397~99~79~099040~Portrait of Maddalena Doni~<em>The Portrait of Maddalena Doni</em> is an oil painting by Italian Renaissance master Raphael, executed between 1506 and 1507. The portrait is one of a pair that depict a recently married merchant and his wife. Agnolo Doni married Maddalena Strozzi in 1503, but Raphael's portraits were probably executed in 1506, the period in which the painter studied the art of Leonardo da Vinci most closely. The composition of the portraits resembles that of the Mona Lisa: the figures are presented in the same way in respect to the picture plane, and their hands, like those of the Mona Lisa, are placed on top of one another. But the low horizon of the landscape background permits a careful assessment of the human figure by providing a uniform light which defines surfaces and volumes. This relationship between landscape and figure presents a clear contrast to the striking settings of Leonardo, which communicate the threatening presence of nature.~1506~63~45~Oil on wood~Palazzo Pitti, Florence~$440.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Maddalena_Doni
396~99~79~099030~Portrait of a Young Woman~<em>The Portrait of a Young Woman</em>, also known as <em>La Muta</em>, is a portrait by the Italian Renaissance artist Raphael, c. 1507-1508. It is housed in the Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, in Urbino. The picture portrays an unknown noblewoman over a near-black background, showing some Leonardesque influences. Although only recently attributed to Raphael, it is ranked among the best portraits by his hand.~1507~64~48~Oil on wood~Galleria Nazionale delle Marche, Urbino~$440.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_a_Young_Woman_(La_Muta)
395~99~79~099020~The Deposition~The <em>Deposition<em>, also known as the Pala Baglione, Borghese Deposition or The Entombment, is an oil painting by the Italian High Renaissance painter Raphael. Signed and dated "Raphael Urbinas MDVII (1507)", the painting is in the Galleria Borghese in Rome. It is the central panel of a larger altarpiece commissioned by Atalanta Baglioni of Perugia in honor of her of fallen son, Grifonetto Baglioni. Like many works, it shares elements of the common subjects of the Deposition of Christ, the Lamentation of Christ, and the Entombment of Christ.~1507~184~176~Oil on wood~Galleria Borghese, Rome~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Deposition_(Raphael)
403~99~79~099100~Madonna of the Chair~The <em>Madonna of the Chair</em> or the <em>Madonna della seggiola</em> is a Madonna painting by the Italian renaissance artist Raphael, dating to c. 1513-1514 and housed in the Palazzo Pitti collection in Florence. It depicts Mary embracing the child Christ, while the young John the Baptist devoutly watches. Painted during his Roman period, this Madonna does not have the strict geometrical form and linear style of his earlier Florentine treatments of the same subject. Instead, the warmer colors seem to suggest the influence of Titian and Raphael's rival Sebastiano del Piombo.~1514~71~71~Oil on panel~Palazzo Pitti, Florence~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madonna_della_seggiola
406~100~79~100010~A Man with a Quilted Sleeve~This portrait was eloquently described by Giorgio Vasari in his 1568 biography of Titian. He identified the man as a member of the Barbarigo, an aristocratic Venetian family. The most likely candidate is Gerolamo, who was 30 years old in 1509. He had numerous political and literary contacts and would have helped the young Titian on his path to success.~1509~81~66~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, London~$550.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/A_Man_with_a_Quilted_Sleeve
407~100~79~100020~Flora~<em>Flora</em> is an oil painting by Italian late Renaissance painter Titian, dated to around 1515 and now held at the Uffizi Gallery in Florence. The work was reproduced in numerous 16th century etchings. It portrays an idealized beautiful woman, a model established in the Venetian school by Titian's master Giorgione with his Laura. Her left hands holds a pink-shaded mantle, while another holds a handful of flowers and leaves. The meaning of the painting is disputed: some, basing for example to inscriptions added to the 16th century reproductions, identifies the woman as a courtesan; other consider it a symbol of nuptial love, although her dress is not a dressing one. The identification with Flora, the ancient goddess of Spring and vegetation, derives from the presence of Spring flowers in her hands.~1515~80~63~Oil on canvas~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$800.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flora_(Titian)
408~100~79~100030~Bacchus and Ariadne~<em>Bacchus and Ariadne</em> (1520–23)[1] is an oil painting by Titian. It is one of a cycle of paintings on mythological subjects produced for Alfonso d'Este, the Duke of Ferrara, for the Camerino d'Alabastro – a private room in his palazzo in Ferrara decorated with paintings based on classical texts. An advance payment was given to Raphael, who originally held the commission for the subject of a Triumph of Bacchus. At the time of Raphael's death in 1520, only a preliminary drawing was completed and the commission was then handed to Titian. In the case of Bacchus and Ariadne, the subject matter was derived from the Roman poets Catullus and Ovid. The painting, considered one of Titian's greatest works, now hangs in the National Gallery in London.~1520~176~191~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, London~$1400.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bacchus_and_Ariadne
409~100~79~100040~Venus of Urbino~<em>The Venus of Urbino</em> is a 1538 oil painting by the Italian master Titian. It depicts a nude young woman, identified with the goddess Venus, reclining on a couch or bed in the sumptuous surroundings of a Renaissance palace. It hangs in the Galleria degli Uffizi in Florence. The figure's pose is based on Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510), which Titian completed. In this depiction, Titian has domesticated Venus by moving her to an indoor setting, engaging her with the viewer, and making her sensuality explicit. Devoid as it is of any classical or allegorical trappings – Venus displays none of the attributes of the goddess she is supposed to represent – the painting is unapologetically erotic.~1538~166~119~Oil on canvas~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Venus_of_Urbino
411~101~84~101020~The Calling of St Matthew~<em>The Calling of Saint Matthew</em> is a masterpiece by Caravaggio, depicting the moment at which Jesus Christ inspires Matthew to follow him. It was completed in 1599-1600 for the Contarelli Chapel in the church of the French congregation, San Luigi dei Francesi in Rome, where it remains today. The painting depicts the story from the Gospel of Matthew (Matthew 9:9): "Jesus saw a man named Matthew at his seat in the custom house, and said to him, "Follow me", and Matthew rose and followed Him." Caravaggio depicts Matthew the tax collector sitting at a table with three other men. Jesus Christ and Saint Peter have entered the room, and Jesus is pointing at Matthew. A beam of light illuminates the faces of the men at the table who are looking at Christ.~1599~322~340~Oil on canvas~San Luigi dei Francesi, Rome~$1300.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Calling_of_St_Matthew_(Caravaggio)
412~101~84~101030~Supper at Emmaus~<em>The Supper at Emmaus</em>  is a painting by the Italian Baroque master Caravaggio, and now in the National Gallery in London. The painting depicts the moment when the resurrected but incognito Jesus, reveals himself to two of his disciples (presumed to be Luke and Cleopas), only to soon vanish from their sight. Cleopas wears the scallopshell of a pilgrim. The other apostle wears torn clothes. Cleopas gesticulates in a perspectively-challenging extension of arms in and out of the frame of reference. The standing groom, forehead smooth and face in darkness, appears oblivious to the event. The painting is unusual for the life-sized figures, the dark and blank background. The table lays out a still-life meal. The basket of food teeters perilously over the edge.~1601~141~196~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, London~$1500.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supper_at_Emmaus_(London)_(Caravaggio)
410~101~84~101010~The Cardsharps~<em>The Cardsharps</em> (painted around 1594) is a painting by the Italian Baroque artist Caravaggio. The work represents an important milestone for Caravaggio. He painted it when he was attempting an independent career after leaving the workshop of the Cavaliere Giuseppe Cesari d'Arpino, for whom he had been painting "flowers and fruit", finishing the details for the Cavaliere's mass-produced (and massive) output. The painting shows an expensively-dressed but unworldly boy playing cards with another boy. The second boy, a cardsharp, has extra cards tucked in his belt behind his back, out of sight from the mark but not the viewer, and a sinister older man is peering over the dupe's shoulder and signaling to his young accomplice. The second boy has a dagger handy at his side, and violence is not far away.~1594~94~131~Oil on canvas~Kimbell Art Museum, Fort Worth~$800.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardsharps_(Caravaggio)
417~104~84~104010~Las Meninas~<em>Las Meninas</em> (Spanish for <em>The Maids of Honour</em>) is a 1656 painting by Diego Velázquez, the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age, in the Museo del Prado in Madrid. The work's complex and enigmatic composition raises questions about reality and illusion, and creates an uncertain relationship between the viewer and the figures depicted. Because of these complexities, Las Meninas has been one of the most widely analyzed works in Western painting. The painting shows a large room in the Madrid palace of King Philip IV of Spain, and presents several figures, most identifiable from the Spanish court, captured, according to some commentators, in a particular moment as if in a snapshot. Some look out of the canvas towards the viewer, while others interact among themselves. The young Infanta Margaret Theresa is surrounded by her entourage of maids of honour, chaperone, bodyguard, two dwarfs and a dog. Just behind them, Velázquez portrays himself working at a large canvas. Velázquez looks outwards, beyond the pictorial space to where a viewer of the painting would stand. In the background there is a mirror that reflects the upper bodies of the king and queen. They appear to be placed outside the picture space in a position similar to that of the viewer, although some scholars have speculated that their image is a reflection from the painting Velázquez is shown working on.~1656~318~276~Oil on canvas~Museo del Prado, Madrid~$1200.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Las_Meninas
418~104~84~104020~The Surrender of Breda~<em>La rendición de Breda</em> (English: <em>The Surrender of Breda</em>) is a painting by Velázquez, painted during the years 1634–35, and inspired while Velázquez was visiting Italy with Ambrogio Spinola, the Genoese general who conquered Breda on June 5, 1625. It is considered one of Velázquez's best artworks. Jan Morris has called it "one of the most Spanish of all pictures". The capture of Breda in 1625 was one of the few major successes of Spanish arms in the latter stages of the Eighty Years' War. The Spanish general, the Genoese aristocrat Ambrogio Spinola, conquered Breda in contradiction to the instructions of his superiors. Before its capture the Spanish government had decided that siege warfare of heavily defended towns of the Low Countries was too wasteful and that it would concentrate on the economic blockade of the Dutch republic. The bulk of Spanish forces were diverted to the unfolding vast Thirty Years War.~1634~307~367~Oil on canvas~Museo del Prado, Madrid~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Surrender_of_Breda
419~104~84~104030~Rokeby Venus~<em>The Rokeby Venus</em> is a painting by Diego Velázquez (1599–1660), the leading artist of the Spanish Golden Age. Completed between 1647 and 1651, and probably painted during the artist's visit to Italy, the work depicts the goddess Venus in a sensual pose, lying on a bed and looking into a mirror held by the Roman god of physical love, her son Cupid. Numerous works, from the ancient to the baroque, have been cited as sources of inspiration for Velázquez. The nude Venuses of the Italian painters, such as Giorgione's Sleeping Venus (c. 1510) and Titian's Venus of Urbino (1538), were the main precedents. In this work, Velázquez combined two established poses for Venus: recumbent on a couch or a bed, and gazing at a mirror. She is often described as looking at herself on the mirror, although this is physically impossible since viewers can see her face reflected in their direction. This phenomenon is known as the Venus effect. In a number of ways the painting represents a pictorial departure, through its central use of a mirror, and because it shows the body of Venus turned away from the observer of the painting.~1647~122~177~Oil on canvas~National Gallery, London~$700.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rokeby_Venus
422~105~84~105020~The Prodigal Son in the Tavern~<em>The Prodigal Son in the Brothel</em> is a painting by the Dutch master Rembrandt. It is housed in the Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister of Dresden, Germany. It is signed "REMBRANDT F.". It portrays two people who had been identified as Rembrandt himself and his wife Saskia. In the Protestant contemporary world, the theme of the prodigal son was a frequent subject for works of art due to its moral background.~1637~161~131~Oil on canvas~Gemäldegalerie Alte Meister, Dresden~$920.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Prodigal_Son_in_the_Tavern
423~105~84~105030~The Return of the Prodigal Son~<em>The Return of the Prodigal Son</em> is an oil painting by Rembrandt. It is among the Dutch master's final works, likely completed within two years of his death in 1669. Depicting the moment of the prodigal son's return to his father in the Biblical parable, it is a renowned work described by art historian Kenneth Clark as "a picture which those who have seen the original in Leningrad may be forgiven for claiming as the greatest picture ever painted".~1661~262~205~Oil on canvas~Hermitage Museum, Saint Petersburg~$775.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Return_of_the_Prodigal_Son_(Rembrandt)
420~105~84~105010~The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp~<em>The Anatomy Lesson of Dr. Nicolaes Tulp</em> is a 1632 oil painting by Rembrandt housed in the Mauritshuis museum in The Hague, the Netherlands. Dr. Nicolaes Tulp is pictured explaining the musculature of the arm to medical professionals. Some of the spectators are various doctors who paid commissions to be included in the painting. The painting is signed in the top-left hand corner Rembrant. This may be the first instance of Rembrandt signing a painting with his forename (in its original form) as opposed to the monogramme RHL (Rembrant Harmenszoon of Leiden), and is thus a sign of his growing artistic confidence.~1632~216~170~Oil on canvas~Mauritshuis, The Hague~$1100.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anatomy_Lesson_of_Dr._Nicolaes_Tulp
425~106~84~106020~Girl with a Pearl Earring~<em>Girl with a Pearl Earring</em> is one of Johannes Vermeer's masterworks and, as the name implies, uses a pearl earring for a focal point. Today the painting is kept in the Mauritshuis gallery in The Hague. It is sometimes referred to as "the Mona Lisa of the North" or "the Dutch Mona Lisa". More recent Vermeer literature points to the image being a tronie, the Dutch 17th-century description of a head that was not meant to be a portrait. After the most recent restoration of the painting in 1994, the subtle colour scheme and the intimacy of the girl’s gaze toward the viewer have been greatly enhanced.~1665~44~39~Oil on canvas~Royal Picture Gallery Mauritshuis, The Hague~$600.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Girl_with_a_Pearl_Earring
426~106~84~106030~The Art of Painting~<em>The Art of Painting</em> is a famous 17th century oil on canvas painting by Dutch painter, Johannes Vermeer. Many art historians believe that it is an allegory of painting, hence the alternative title of the painting. After Vermeer's The Procuress it is the largest work by the master. Its composition and iconography also make it the most complex Vermeer work of all.~1666~130~110~Oil on canvas~Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna~$925.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Art_of_Painting
427~106~84~106040~The Love Letter~<em>The Love Letter</em> is a 17th-century genre painting by Jan Vermeer. The painting shows a servant maid handing a letter to a young woman with a cittern. The tied-up curtain in the foreground creates the impression that the viewer is looking at an intensely private, personal scene. There is also an element of trompe l'oeil as Dutch paintings were often hung with little curtains to conserve them, and the device of painted curtains is seen in other Dutch works of the period. The diagonals on the chequered floor create the impression of depth and three-dimensionality. The fact that it is a love letter that the woman has received is made clear by the fact that she is carrying a lute (more specifically, a cittern, a member of the lute/guitar family). The lute was a symbol of love - often carnal love; luit was also a slang term for vagina. This idea is further reinforced by the slippers at the very bottom of the picture. The removed slipper was another symbol of sex. The floor brush would appear to represent domesticity, and its placement at the side of the painting may suggest that domestic concerns have been forgotten or pushed aside.~1666~44~38~Oil on canvas~Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam~$900.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Love_Letter_(Vermeer)
424~106~84~106010~The Milkmaid~<em>The Milkmaid</em> is an oil-on-canvas painting of a "milkmaid", in fact a domestic kitchen maid, by the Dutch artist Johannes Vermeer. It is now in the Rijksmuseum in Amsterdam, Netherlands, which regards it as "unquestionably one of the museum's finest attractions". The painting is strikingly illusionistic, conveying not just details but a sense of the weight of the woman and the table. "The light, though bright, doesn't wash out the rough texture of the bread crusts or flatten the volumes of the maid's thick waist and rounded shoulders", wrote Karen Rosenberg, an art critic for The New York Times. Yet with half of the woman's face in shadow, it is "impossible to tell whether her downcast eyes and pursed lips express wistfulness or concentration," she wrote.~1657~46~41~Oil on canvas~Rijksmuseum, Amsterdam~$525.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Milkmaid_(Vermeer)
431~109~83~109010~Age of Innocence~<em>The Age of Innocence</em> is an oil on canvas picture by Sir Joshua Reynolds, painted in either 1785 or 1788 and measuring 765 x 638 mm. The sitter is unknown, but was possibly Reynolds's great-niece Theophila Gwatkin (who was three in 1785), or Lady Anne Spencer (1773–1865), the youngest daughter of the 4th Duke of Marlborough. The picture is a character study, or, in 18th-century terms, a fancy picture, and was painted over another Reynolds work, A Strawberry Girl, perhaps because Strawberry had suffered some paint losses. Only the hands remain in their original state. Innocence itself has deteriorated since 1859. The picture was presented to the National Gallery in 1847 by Robert Vernon, and has hung in the Tate since 1951. The picture became a favourite with the public, and was copied hundreds of times.~1788~76~64~Oil on canvas~Tate Britain Museum, London~$500.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Age_of_Innocence_(painting)

434~110~83~110020~Blue Boy~<em>The Blue Boy</em>is an oil painting by Thomas Gainsborough. Perhaps Gainsborough's most famous work, it is thought to be a portrait of Jonathan Buttall (1752–1805), the son of a wealthy hardware merchant, although this has never been proven. It is an historical costume study as well as a portrait: the youth in his 17th-century apparel is regarded as Gainsborough's homage to Anthony Van Dyck, and in particular is very close to Van Dyck's portrait of Charles II as a boy.~1770~177~112~Oil on Canvas~Huntington Library, San Marino, California~$900.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Blue_Boy
435~110~83~110030~Portrait of Mrs. Sarah Siddons~Sarah Siddons was the outstanding tragic actress of her time. Reynolds and other artists also painted her portrait.

It was acquired by the National Gallery of Art in 1937. Mrs. Sheridan (Elizabeth Ann Linley) was a talented musician who enjoyed professional success in Bath and London before marrying Richard Brinsley Sheridan in 1773 and abandoning her career. She was 31 when she sat for Gainsborough.

440~114~78~114010~Lamentation of Christ~<em>The Lamentation of Christ</em> is a very common subject in Christian art from the High Middle Ages to the Baroque. After Jesus was crucified, his body was removed from the cross and his friends and family mourned over his body.

It is generally dated to around 1310. The painting has a traditional Christian subject, representing the Virgin Mary and the Christ Child seated on her lap, with saints surrounding the two. It is celebrated often as the first painting of the Renaissance due to its newfound naturalism and escape from the constraints of Gothic art.~1310~325~204~Tempura on Wood~Uffizi Gallery, Florence~$2000.00~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ognissanti_Madonna
443~116~77~116010~Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle~<em>Portrait of the Artist Holding a Thistle</em> is an oil painting on parchment pasted on canvas by German artist Albrecht Dürer, painted in 1493. It is the earliest of Dürer's painted self-portraits and has been identified as one of the first self-portraits painted by a Northern artist. The date, and the plant in the artist's hand, seem to suggest that this is a betrothal portrait.~1493~57~44~Oil on Wood~Louvre, Paris~$675.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_the_Artist_Holding_a_Thistle_(Albrecht_D%C3%BCrer)

It is an allegorical composition which has been the subject of many interpretations. One of the most famous old master prints, it has sometimes been regarded as forming one of a conscious group of Meisterstiche ("master prints") with his Knight, Death and the Devil (1513) and Saint Jerome in his Study (1514).~1514~24~19~Engraving~National Gallery of Victoria, Australia~$450.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melencolia_I
446~118~77~118010~Landscape with the Fall of Icarus~<em>Landscape with the Fall of Icarus</em> is a painting in oil on canvas long thought to be by Pieter Bruegel, although following technical examinations in 1996, that attribution is regarded as very doubtful, and it is now usually seen as a good early copy by an unknown artist of Bruegel's original, perhaps painted in the 1560s, although recent technical research has re-opened the question.~1558~74~112~Oil on canvas mounted on wood~Royal Museums of Fine Arts of Belgium~$775.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Landscape_with_the_Fall_of_Icarus

Critics have praised the composition for its ordered portrayal and integrated scene. There are approximately 112 identifiable idioms or proverbs in the scene, although Bruegel may have included others which cannot be determined.~1559~117~163~Oil on Panel~Staatliche Museen, Berlin~$750.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Netherlandish_Proverbs

450~120~80~120010~Portrait of Eleanor of Toledo~<em>The Portrait of Eleanor of Toledo and Her Son</em> is a painting by the Italian artist Agnolo di Cosimo, known as Bronzino, finished ca. 1545. One of his most famous works, it is housed in the Uffizi Gallery of Florence, Italy and is considered one of the preeminent examples of Mannerist portraiture. The painting depicts Eleanor of Toledo, the wife of Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany, sitting with her hand resting on the shoulder of one of her sons. This gesture, as well as the pomegranate motif on her dress, referred to her role as mother. Eleanor wears a heavily brocaded dress with black arabesques. In this pose, she is depicted as the ideal woman of the Renaissance.~1545~115~96~Oil on Panel~Uffizi, Florence~$850.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Portrait_of_Eleanor_of_Toledo

Along with Vincent van Gogh's The Starry Night, some landscapes by William Turner, and some works by Monet, it is among the best known depictions of the sky in Western art, and features sharp color contrast between the sky and the hills below. Painted in a Mannerist (or Baroque) style, the work takes liberties with the actual layout of Toledo (some buildings are depicted in different positions than their actual location, but truthfully depicts on the side the Castle of San Servando).~1600~121~108~Oil on canvas~Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York City~$800.00~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/View_of_Toledo
