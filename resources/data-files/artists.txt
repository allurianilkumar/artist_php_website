1~Pablo~Picasso~Spain~1881~1973~Pablo Diego José Francisco de Paula Juan Nepomuceno María de los Remedios Cipriano de la Santísima Trinidad Ruiz y Picasso known as Pablo Ruiz Picasso was a Spanish painter, draughtsman, and sculptor who lived most of his life in France. He is widely known for co-founding the Cubist movement and for the wide variety of styles that he helped develop and explore. Among his most famous works are the proto-Cubist Les Demoiselles d'Avignon (1907) and Guernica (1937), a portrayal of the German bombing of Guernica during the Spanish Civil War.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picasso
2~Henri~Matisse~France~1869~1954~Henri Matisse was a French artist, known for his use of colour and his fluid and original draughtsmanship. He was a draughtsman, printmaker, and sculptor, but is known primarily as a painter. Matisse is commonly regarded, along with Picasso and Marcel Duchamp, as one of the three artists who helped to define the revolutionary developments in the plastic arts in the opening decades of the 20th century, responsible for significant developments in painting and sculpture. Although he was initially labelled a Fauve (wild beast), by the 1920s he was increasingly hailed as an upholder of the classical tradition in French painting. His mastery of the expressive language of colour and drawing, displayed in a body of work spanning over a half-century, won him recognition as a leading figure in modern art~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matisse
5~Jacques-Louis~David~France~1748~1825~Jacques-Louis David was a French painter in the Neoclassical style, considered to be the preeminent painter of the era. In the 1780s his cerebral brand of history painting marked a change in taste away from Rococo frivolity toward a classical austerity and severity, heightened feeling chiming with the moral climate of the final years of the Ancien Régime. David later became an active supporter of the French Revolution and friend of Maximilien Robespierre (1758–1794), and was effectively a dictator of the arts under the French Republic. Imprisoned after Robespierre's fall from power, he aligned himself with yet another political regime upon his release, that of Napoleon I. It was at this time that he developed his Empire style, notable for its use of warm Venetian colours. David had a huge number of pupils, making him the strongest influence in French art of the early 19th century, especially academic Salon painting.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacques-Louis_David
6~Jean-Auguste-Dominique~Ingres~France~1780~1867~Jean-Auguste-Dominique Ingres was a French Neoclassical painter. Although he considered himself to be a painter of history in the tradition of Nicolas Poussin and Jacques-Louis David, by the end of his life it was Ingres's portraits, both painted and drawn, that were recognized as his greatest legacy.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ingres
7~Eugene~Delacroix~France~1798~1863~Eugène Delacroix was a French Romantic artist regarded from the outset of his career as the leader of the French Romantic school. Delacroix's use of expressive brushstrokes and his study of the optical effects of colour profoundly shaped the work of the Impressionists, while his passion for the exotic inspired the artists of the Symbolist movement. A fine lithographer, Delacroix illustrated various works of William Shakespeare, the Scottish writer Walter Scott and the German writer Johann Wolfgang von Goethe.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eug%C3%A8ne_Delacroix
10~Gustave~Courbet~France~1818~1877~Jean Désiré Gustave Courbet was a French painter who led the Realist movement in 19th-century French painting. The Realist movement bridged the Romantic movement (characterized by the paintings of Théodore Géricault and Eugène Delacroix), with the Barbizon School and the Impressionists. Courbet occupies an important place in 19th century French painting as an innovator and as an artist willing to make bold social commentary in his work.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Courbet
12~Edouard~Manet~France~1832~1883~Édouard Manet was a French painter. One of the first 19th-century artists to approach modern-life subjects, he was a pivotal figure in the transition from Realism to Impressionism.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Manet
13~James Abbott~Whistler~USA~1834~1903~James Abbott McNeill Whistler was an American-born, British-based artist. Averse to sentimentality and moral allusion in painting, he was a leading proponent of the credo "art for art's sake". His famous signature for his paintings was in the shape of a stylized butterfly possessing a long stinger for a tail. The symbol was apt, for it combined both aspects of his personality—his art was characterized by a subtle delicacy, while his public persona was combative. Finding a parallel between painting and music, Whistler titled many of his paintings "arrangements", "harmonies", and "nocturnes", emphasizing the primacy of tonal harmony. His most famous painting is Whistler's Mother (1871), the revered and oft parodied portrait of motherhood. Whistler influenced the art world and the broader culture of his time with his artistic theories and his friendships with leading artists and writers.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Abbott_McNeill_Whistler
14~Pierre Auguste~Renoir~France~1841~1919~Pierre-Auguste Renoir was a French artist who was a leading painter in the development of the Impressionist style. As a celebrator of beauty, and especially feminine sensuality, it has been said that "Renoir is the final representative of a tradition which runs directly from Rubens to Watteau."~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Renoir
15~Edgar~Degas~France~1834~1917~Edgar Degas, born Hilaire-Germain-Edgar De Gas, was a French artist famous for his work in painting, sculpture, printmaking and drawing. He is regarded as one of the founders of Impressionism although he rejected the term, and preferred to be called a realist. A superb draughtsman, he is especially identified with the subject of the dance, and over half of his works depict dancers. These display his mastery in the depiction of movement, as do his racecourse subjects and female nudes. His portraits are notable for their psychological complexity and depiction of human isolation.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Degas
17~Claude~Monet~France~1840~1926~Claude Monet was a founder of French impressionist painting, and the most consistent and prolific practitioner of the movement's philosophy of expressing one's perceptions before nature, especially as applied to plein-air landscape painting. The term Impressionism is derived from the title of his painting Impression, Sunrise (Impression, soleil levant).~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Claude_Monet
18~Paul~Gauguin~France~1848~1903~Eugène Henri Paul Gauguin was a leading French Post-Impressionist artist. He was an important figure in the Symbolist movement as a painter, sculptor, print-maker, ceramist, and writer. His bold experimentation with coloring led directly to the Synthetist style of modern art while his expression of the inherent meaning of the subjects in his paintings, under the influence of the cloisonnist style, paved the way to Primitivism and the return to the pastoral. He was also an influential proponent of wood engraving and woodcuts as art forms.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gauguin
19~Vincent~Van Gogh~Netherlands~1853~1890~Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch post-Impressionist painter whose work, notable for its rough beauty, emotional honesty, and bold color, had a far-reaching influence on 20th-century art. After years of painful anxiety and frequent bouts of mental illness, he died at the age of 37 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. His work was then known to only a handful of people and appreciated by fewer still.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Van_Gogh
20~Georges~Seurat~France~1859~1891~Georges-Pierre Seurat was a French Post-Impressionist painter and draftsman. He is noted for his innovative use of drawing media and for devising a technique of painting known as pointillism. His large-scale work A Sunday Afternoon on the Island of La Grande Jatte (1884–1886), Seurat's most famous painting, altered the direction of modern art by initiating Neo-impressionism, and is one of the icons of 19th century painting.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seurat
21~Paul~Cezanne~France~1839~1906~Paul Cézanne was a French artist and Post-Impressionist painter whose work laid the foundations of the transition from the 19th century conception of artistic endeavour to a new and radically different world of art in the 20th century. Cézanne can be said to form the bridge between late 19th century Impressionism and the early 20th century's new line of artistic enquiry, Cubism. The line attributed to both Matisse and Picasso that Cézanne "is the father of us all" cannot be easily dismissed.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C%C3%A9zanne
24~Edvard~Munch~Norway~1863~1944~Edvard Munch was a Norwegian Symbolist painter, printmaker and an important forerunner of expressionist art. His best-known composition, The Scream, is part of a series The Frieze of Life, in which Munch explored the themes of love, fear, death, melancholia, and anxiety.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edvard_Munch
29~Gustav~Klimt~Austria~1862~1918~Gustav Klimt was an Austrian Symbolist painter and one of the most prominent members of the Vienna Secession movement. His major works include paintings, murals, sketches, and other art objects. Klimt's primary subject was the female body, and his works are marked by a frank eroticism—nowhere is this more apparent than in his numerous drawings in pencil~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Klimt
45~Salvidor~Dali~Spain~1904~1989~Salvador Domènec Felip Jacint Dalí i Domènech, Marquis de Púbol, commonly known as Salvador Dalí was a prominent Spanish Catalan surrealist painter born in Figueres.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salvador_Dal%C3%AD
63~Henri~Rousseau~France~1844~1910~Henri Julien Félix Rousseau was a French Post-Impressionist painter in the Naive or Primitive manner. He was also known as Le Douanier (the customs officer), a humorous description of his occupation as a tax collector. Ridiculed during his life, he came to be recognized as a self-taught genius whose works are of high artistic quality.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henri_Rousseau
91~~Masaccio~Italy~1401~1428~Masaccio, born Tommaso di Ser Giovanni di Simone, was the first great painter of the Quattrocento period of the Italian Renaissance. According to Vasari, Masaccio was the best painter of his generation because of his skill at recreating lifelike figures and movements as well as a convincing sense of three-dimensionality. Masaccio died at twenty-six and little is known about the exact circumstances of his death.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masaccio
92~Filippo~Lippi~Italy~1406~1469~Filippo Lippi, also called Lippo Lippi, was an Italian painter of the Italian Quattrocento (15th century).~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filippo_Lippi
93~Piero della~Francesca~Italy~1412~1492~<strong>Piero della Francesca</strong> was a painter of the Early Renaissance. As testified by Giorgio Vasari in his <em>Lives of the Artists</em>, to contemporaries he was also known as a mathematician and geometer. Nowadays Piero della Francesca is chiefly appreciated for his art. His painting was characterized by its serene humanism, its use of geometric forms and perspective. His most famous work is the cycle of frescoes "The Legend of the True Cross" in the church of San Francesco in the Tuscan town of Arezzo.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piero_della_Francesca
94~Andrea~Mantegna~Italy~1431~1506~<strong>Andrea Mantegna</strong> was an Italian painter, a student of Roman archeology, and son in law of Jacopo Bellini. Like other artists of the time, Mantegna experimented with perspective, e.g., by lowering the horizon in order to create a sense of greater monumentality. His flinty, metallic landscapes and somewhat stony figures give evidence of a fundamentally sculptural approach to painting. He also led a workshop that was the leading producer of prints in Venice before 1500.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrea_Mantegna
95~Sandro~Botticelli~Italy~1445~1510~Alessandro di Mariano di Vanni Filipepi, better known as <strong>Sandro Botticelli</strong> was an Italian painter of the Early Renaissance. He belonged to the Florentine school under the patronage of Lorenzo de' Medici, a movement that Giorgio Vasari would characterize less than a hundred years later as a "golden age", a thought, suitably enough, he expressed at the head of his Vita of Botticelli. Botticelli's posthumous reputation suffered until the late 19th century; since then his work has been seen to represent the linear grace of Early Renaissance painting. Among his best known works are The Birth of Venus and Primavera.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sandro_Botticelli
96~Pietro~Perugino~Italy~1446~1524~<strong>Pietro Perugino</strong>, born Pietro Vannucci, was an Italian Renaissance painter of the Umbrian school, who developed some of the qualities that found classic expression in the High Renaissance. Raphael was his most famous pupil.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pietro_Perugino
97~Leonardo~da Vinci~Italy~1452~1519~<strong>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci</strong> was an Italian Renaissance polymath: painter, sculptor, architect, musician, mathematician, engineer, inventor, anatomist, geologist, cartographer, botanist, and writer. His genius, perhaps more than that of any other figure, epitomized the Renaissance humanist ideal. Leonardo has often been described as the archetype of the Renaissance Man, a man of "unquenchable curiosity" and "feverishly inventive imagination". He is widely considered to be one of the greatest painters of all time and perhaps the most diversely talented person ever to have lived. According to art historian Helen Gardner, the scope and depth of his interests were without precedent and "his mind and personality seem to us superhuman, the man himself mysterious and remote". Marco Rosci states that while there is much speculation about Leonardo, his vision of the world is essentially logical rather than mysterious, and that the empirical methods he employed were unusual for his time.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leonardo_da_Vinci
98~~Michelangelo~Italy~1475~1564~<strong>Michelangelo di Lodovico Buonarroti Simoni</strong> commonly known as Michelangelo, was an Italian sculptor, painter, architect, poet, and engineer of the High Renaissance who exerted an unparalleled influence on the development of Western art. Despite making few forays beyond the arts, his versatility in the disciplines he took up was of such a high order that he is often considered a contender for the title of the archetypal Renaissance man, along with his fellow Italian Leonardo da Vinci. Michelangelo was considered the greatest living artist in his lifetime, and ever since then he has been held to be one of the greatest artists of all time. A number of his works in painting, sculpture, and architecture rank among the most famous in existence. His output in every field during his long life was prodigious; when the sheer volume of correspondence, sketches, and reminiscences that survive is also taken into account, he is the best-documented artist of the 16th century.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michelangelo
99~~Raphael~Italy~1483~1520~Raffaello Sanzio da Urbino, better known simply as <strong>Raphael</strong>, was an Italian painter and architect of the High Renaissance. His work is admired for its clarity of form and ease of composition and for its visual achievement of the Neoplatonic ideal of human grandeur. Together with Michelangelo and Leonardo da Vinci, he forms the traditional trinity of great masters of that period.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raphael
100~~Titian~Italy~1488~1576~<strong>Tiziano Vecelli</strong> known in English as <strong>Titian</strong> was an Italian painter, the most important member of the 16th-century Venetian school. He was born in Pieve di Cadore, near Belluno (in Veneto), in the Republic of Venice. During his lifetime he was often called da Cadore, taken from the place of his birth. During the course of his long life, Titian's artistic manner changed drastically[4] but he retained a lifelong interest in color. Although his mature works may not contain the vivid, luminous tints of his early pieces, their loose brushwork and subtlety of polychromatic modulations are without precedent in the history of Western art.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Titian
101~~Caravaggio~Italy~1571~1610~<strong>Michelangelo Merisi da Caravaggio</strong> was an Italian artist active in Rome, Naples, Malta, and Sicily between 1593 and 1610. His paintings, which combine a realistic observation of the human state, both physical and emotional, with a dramatic use of lighting, had a formative influence on the Baroque school of painting.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caravaggio
104~Diego~Velázquez~Spain~1599~1660~<strong>Diego Rodríguez de Silva y Velázquez</strong> was a Spanish painter who was the leading artist in the court of King Philip IV. He was an individualistic artist of the contemporary Baroque period, important as a portrait artist. In addition to numerous renditions of scenes of historical and cultural significance, he painted scores of portraits of the Spanish royal family, other notable European figures, and commoners.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diego_Vel%C3%A1zquez
105~~Rembrandt~Netherlands~1606~1669~<strong>Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn</strong> was a Dutch painter and etcher. He is generally considered one of the greatest painters and printmakers in European art history and the most important in Dutch history. His contributions to art came in a period of great wealth and cultural achievement that historians call the Dutch Golden Age when Dutch Golden Age painting, although in many ways antithetical to the Baroque style that dominated Europe, was extremely prolific and innovative.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rembrandt
106~Jan~Vermeer~Netherlands~1632~1675~<strong>Jan Vermeer</strong> was a Dutch painter who specialized in domestic interior scenes of middle-class life. Vermeer was a moderately successful provincial genre painter in his lifetime. He seems never to have been particularly wealthy, leaving his wife and children in debt at his death, perhaps because he produced relatively few paintings. Vermeer worked slowly and with great care, using bright colours and sometimes expensive pigments, with a preference for cornflower blue and yellow. He is particularly renowned for his masterly treatment and use of light in his work.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Johannes_Vermeer
109~Joshua~Reynolds~England~1740~1790~<strong>Sir Joshua Reynolds</strong> was an influential eighteenth-century English painter, specialising in portraits and promoting the "Grand Style" in painting which depended on idealization of the imperfect. He was one of the founders and first president of the Royal Academy, and was knighted by George III in 1769.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Joshua_Reynolds
110~Thomas~Gainsborough~England~1737~1788~<strong>Thomas Gainsborough</strong> was an English portrait and landscape painter. He is credited as the originator of the 18th century British landscape school.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thomas_Gainsborough
114~~Giotto~Italy~1266~1337~<strong>Giotto di Bondone</strong> better known simply as Giotto, was an Italian painter and architect from Florence in the late Middle Ages. He is generally considered the first in a line of great artists who contributed to the Italian Renaissance.~https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giotto
116~Albrecht~Dürer~Germany~1471~1528~<strong>Albrecht Dürer </strong> was a German painter, engraver, printmaker, mathematician, and theorist from Nuremberg. His high-quality woodcuts established his reputation and influence across Europe when he was still in his twenties, and he has been conventionally regarded as the greatest artist of the Northern Renaissance ever since. His vast body of work includes altarpieces and religious works, numerous portraits and self-portraits, and copper engravings. The woodcuts, such as the Apocalypse series (1498), retain a more Gothic flavour than the rest of his work. His well-known prints include the Knight, Death, and the Devil (1513), Saint Jerome in his Study (1514) and Melencolia I (1514), which has been the subject of extensive analysis and interpretation. His watercolours also mark him as one of the first European landscape artists, while his ambitious woodcuts revolutionized the potential of that medium. Dürer's introduction of classical motifs into Northern art, through his knowledge of Italian artists and German humanists, has secured his reputation as one of the most important figures of the Northern Renaissance. This is reinforced by his theoretical treatises, which involve principles of mathematics, perspective and ideal proportions.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Albrecht_D%C3%Bcrer
118~Pieter~Bruegel the Elder~Netherlands~1525~1569~<strong>Pieter Bruegel (Brueghel) the Elder</strong> was a Flemish Renaissance painter and printmaker known for his landscapes and peasant scenes (so called genre painting). He is sometimes referred to as the "Peasant Bruegel." From 1559 he dropped the 'h' from his name and signed his paintings as Bruegel.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pieter_Bruegel_the_Elder
120~Agnolo~Bronzino~Italy~1503~1572~One of the greatest painters of the sixteenth century, Agnolo di Cosimo Tori, known as <strong>Bronzino</strong>, embodied the Mannerist style in the years of the government of Cosimo I de’ Medici.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bronzino
121~El~Greco~Greece~1514~1614~<strong>El Greco</strong>, born Doménikos Theotokópoulos,  was a painter, sculptor and architect of the Spanish Renaissance. "El Greco" (The Greek) was a nickname,a reference to his national Greek origin. El Greco's dramatic and expressionistic style was met with puzzlement by his contemporaries but found appreciation in the 20th century. El Greco is regarded as a precursor of both Expressionism and Cubism.~http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/El_Greco
